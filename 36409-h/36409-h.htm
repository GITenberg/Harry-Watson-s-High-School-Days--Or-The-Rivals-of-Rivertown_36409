<h2><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—HARRY SHOWS HIS METTLE</h2>
<p>
“Hey, fellows, we’ve a new student at Rivertown
High!”
</p>
<p>
“Who is he, Socker?” chorused a group of
boys to whom their schoolmate had come running
with his tidings.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t know. Nettie told me that she and
Viola had met him as he was coming out of Principal
Larmore’s office.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and you’d better watch out, Elmer.
Nettie said Viola has been talking about nothing
else but that good-looking fellow since she saw
him!” bantered another of the group.
</p>
<p>
The boy, light and rather handsome, but with
a weak face, to whom this last remark had been
addressed was about to reply, when a warning
was sounded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
</p>
<p>
“Keep quiet! Here he comes now!” declared
Socker.
</p>
<p>
Instantly all eyes were turned in the direction
of the schoolhouse where they saw a lad walking
with a swinging stride. Apparently about fifteen
years of age, he was well built and rather tall.
Dark hair, which curled about his cap, and laughing
eyes bespoke him as a jolly, handsome fellow,
and the ruddy glow brought to his cheeks by the
crisp winter air was evidence that he was possessed
of health in abundance.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I know who he is!” asserted another of
the group.
</p>
<p>
“Who?”
</p>
<p>
“He must be Harry Watson, nephew of the
Widow Watson. I remember Mrs. Watson told
mother the other day that her nephew, Harry,
was coming to Rivertown.”
</p>
<p>
“Where’s he from?”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t say.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, let’s see if he’s any good!” exclaimed
a big, hulking fellow, Pud Snooks, who was the
bully of the school. “Hey, you, Watson, come
over here!” he shouted.
</p>
<p>
Rivertown High School, a two-story brick building
containing some fifteen class rooms and a large
assembly room, was situated on a bluff overlooking
the Conoque River: and the road leading from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
it to the village, in addition to being steep, made
a sharp turn at the foot of the hill.
</p>
<p>
The spot was a favorite one with the scholars
for coasting, and several of the boys had been in
the act of placing a double-runner bob in position
at the top of the hill, when they had been apprised
of the fact there was a new student in
school.
</p>
<p>
The boys of Rivertown High had a fondness
for trying out new students, and Pud’s suggestion
met with ready approval.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, when the bully proposed putting
Harry Watson to the test, the other boys sat
down on the double-runner, taking good care to
leave the steering seat vacant.
</p>
<p>
“When I shove off, everybody stand up!”
whispered Pud. Then he exclaimed aloud:
</p>
<p>
“Hey, Watson! Can you steer a sled?”
</p>
<p>
Stopping as he heard his name, Harry looked
toward the group of boys.
</p>
<p>
“Sure thing, if you’d like to have me,” he answered.
“My name is Harry Watson.”
</p>
<p>
“And mine’s Pud Snooks,” announced the bully.
Then bowing in mock seriousness, he continued:
</p>
<p>
“That fancy blonde behind me is Elmer Craven.
He is the richest and most famous personage
we have at Rivertown High. Twice a week
he goes across the river to Lumberport, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
believes that Viola Darrow is never happy
when——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, cut it out, Pud!” growled Elmer.
</p>
<p>
With a grin, the bully went on with his introductions.
</p>
<p>
“The next exhibit is Socker Gales, and the
specimen with the ten-foot reach is Longback,
whom his family calls Sam Dalton. Now just
take the ropes and I’ll push off. We’re a precious
load, as I hope I’ve made clear to you, so don’t
tip us over!”
</p>
<p>
While Harry had been acknowledging these
bantering introductions, he had also been looking
at the icy roadway.
</p>
<p>
A glance at the sharp turn had told him it would
require clever work to make it, and so, when he
took the steering ropes, instead of sitting down
on the sled, he gave them a quick jerk—to have
one of them part near the runner.
</p>
<p>
“Good thing that didn’t happen on the hill!”
he exclaimed, quickly cutting off the broken end
and making a new knot, after which he again
tested the rope and found it sound.
</p>
<p>
Pud and his chums, however, though they pretended
to, did not share this opinion, and that
there might not be more delay, as soon as Harry
sat down and placed his feet on the bracers, the
bully started the sled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’re off!” he shouted, as he gave the double-runner
a terrific shove.
</p>
<p>
As though eager for the fun, the first sled shot
over the crest of the hill—and then all the boys
put their feet down and let the sled pass between
their legs!
</p>
<p>
Instantly Harry realized that he was alone on
the double-runner.
</p>
<p>
With no weight on the hind sled, he knew it
would bump and slew as soon as he got fairly
started and especially when he struck the curve.
But Harry was game.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll show these Rivertown High chaps that
they can’t stump me by any of their tricks,” he
said to himself, and braced his feet more firmly,
leaning back to throw as much weight as possible
on the hind sled.
</p>
<p>
As the double-runner gained momentum, it fairly
danced over the icy roadway.
</p>
<p>
Behind, Pud and his cronies were hurrying as
fast as they could that they might gain a spot
whence they could see the spill they expected
when the sled struck the curve.
</p>
<p>
But as Harry approached the turn, he leaned
far out.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you Pud! You guessed wrong when you
picked Watson for an easy mark,” chuckled Longback.
“That boy knows something about steering.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
</p>
<p>
The next instant, however, the disappointment
of the boys at learning that they were not to have
the fun of seeing Harry dumped, was forgotten
in their alarm at hearing shouts of warning and
fright beyond the curve!
</p>
<p>
Just as Harry’s sled dashed around the turn,
he had caught sight of two little children starting
up the hill, dragging their sleds behind them.
</p>
<p>
A group of high school girls, among them
Viola Darrow and her chum, Nettie Masterson,
were descending the hill, and it was they who,
when they heard the rattlety-bang of the double-runner,
and saw the toddlers ahead, had cried
out in terror.
</p>
<p>
One side of the road was banked by the hill,
while the other dropped down toward the river;
a fence with one rail some three feet from the
ground serving as a guard.
</p>
<p>
What was below the embankment Harry did
not know, but he remembered to have seen some
bushes as he had walked up the hill.
</p>
<p>
In their effort to save the children, the girls
had run out into the roadway, practically blocking
it.
</p>
<p>
So great was Harry’s speed, however, that
they realized it would be impossible for them to
seize the toddlers and get them to one side in
time to let the double-runner pass—and in such a
manner were they spread across the road that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
Harry had no chance to guide his sled past them.
</p>
<p>
“Open out! Let him through!” shouted Longback
and Socker; while Elmer and Pud, terrified
at the impending tragedy threatened by their trick,
simply stared at the scene in silence, their faces
white, their mouths agape.
</p>
<p>
But in the instant that had followed his discovery
of the little girls starting up the roadway,
Harry had made up his mind what to do—and
acted.
</p>
<p>
With a sudden pull, he jerked the sled from its
course, headed it between two of the posts which
supported the guard-rail—and the double-runner
leaped over the embankment at a spot less than
six feet from where the group of girls and the two
children stood, panic-stricken and crying.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—JED BROWN FINDS A PROTECTOR</h2>
<p>
Several of the other boys who were members
of Rivertown High, among them Paul Martin and
Jerry Post, had reached the turn just in time to
see the sled as it took its mad leap over the embankment.
</p>
<p>
For a moment, they, as well as the girls, gazed
in silence at the spot where the double-runner
with its lone passenger had disappeared. Then,
as with one accord, they broke into lusty cheers
at the aversion of the tragedy which had seemed
inevitable.
</p>
<p>
But their joy was quickly checked.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t cheer! You don’t know what has happened
to that nervy chap!” shouted Paul Martin.
</p>
<p>
And as his words brought silence, he and Jerry
rushed to the edge of the embankment, while the
others followed.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately Harry had landed in a pile of underbrush,
and as the white-faced boys and girls
lined the rail he was picking his way out, none the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
worse for his experience save a few rents in his
clothes.
</p>
<p>
The sight of the boy, safe and sound, brought
a reaction from the terror, and wildly the scholars
cheered, while Paul, Jerry and Longback ducked
under the guard-rail and slipped and slid down to
meet the hero.
</p>
<p>
“Hurt?” asked Jerry, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Nowhere, except in my clothes,” returned
Harry—and again prolonged cheers greeted his
ears.
</p>
<p>
Many were the willing hands that were extended
to help draw him up into the road, and when they
had succeeded, he became immediately the centre
of an excited, admiring group.
</p>
<p>
“I think that was just perfectly splendid of
him!” exclaimed Viola. “Some of you boys introduce
me to him, won’t you?”
</p>
<p>
As she spoke, the girl, whose beauty and wealth
made her the favorite of the school, looked
straight at Elmer—but he gave no sign that he
noticed her.
</p>
<p>
Their leader having thus given the stamp of
approval to Harry, the other girls quickly pressed
forward, all talking and chatting at once.
</p>
<p>
But no one responded to Viola’s request and,
flushing, she turned away while the new student
grew very red, as he looked from one to another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
of the boys who had invited him to steer the
double-runner.
</p>
<p>
The situation was awkward in the extreme and
Harry, diffident and sensitive as he was, felt it
keenly. Yet he was the one to relieve it.
</p>
<p>
“Hey, you Snooks, you’d better go down and
get your sled—or do you want me to do that?”
he called.
</p>
<p>
“So it was one of Pud’s tricks?” exclaimed
Nettie. “We might have known it, Viola. Pud,
I think you’re perfectly horrid!” and with all
the dignity of her fifteen years, the girl turned her
back on the bully and, putting her arm through
Viola’s, led her away down the hill. But as they
went, both girls smiled at Harry.
</p>
<p>
During the embarrassing scene, Longback had
whispered to some of the other boys who Harry
was, and Jerry and Paul immediately took him in
tow.
</p>
<p>
“If you don’t mind, we’ll walk home with you,
Watson,” exclaimed Jerry. And glad of the
chance to escape the attention of the other members
of Rivertown High, Harry started off, accompanied
by the two boys who were later to become
his chums.
</p>
<p>
The story of Harry’s quick-wittedness and courage
had proceeded him, thanks to Viola and Nettie;
and as he walked down the main street of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
town to the comfortable home of his aunt, many
were the glances directed toward him.
</p>
<p>
“Rather a bad start, I’m afraid,” he said to his
companions, with a feeble attempt at a smile.
</p>
<p>
“Bad? I should say it was a corking fine one!”
returned Paul, sincerely. “It isn’t many fellows
who can become a hero and at the same time get
the best of Pud Snooks!”
</p>
<p>
The mention of the bully caused Harry to grow
serious.
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid it will make Snooks down on me,”
he said. “He had no idea that those little girls
would be in the road.”
</p>
<p>
Well did Jerry and Paul know that the outcome
of the bully’s trick, sensational as it had
been, would, indeed, arouse his anger against the
boy who had turned the tables on him; and
though they tried to disabuse Harry’s mind of the
idea, it was with relief that they reached the gate
of the Widow Watson’s house.
</p>
<p>
Despite Harry’s cordial invitation, both boys
declined to go in, and he entered the house feeling
strangely alone.
</p>
<p>
His aunt’s greeting and loving words of praise
after she had heard of his experience, however,
did much to restore his good spirits.
</p>
<p>
“Who is Viola?” he asked, as they were seated
at dinner.
</p>
<p>
“She is the daughter of one of the wealthiest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
men in Rivertown,” replied the widow, a shade
of sorrow passing over her face. “What makes
you ask?”
</p>
<p>
“Because she said my steering over the embankment
was perfectly fine!”
</p>
<p>
Again the cloud passed over Mrs. Watson’s
face and this time it did not lift.
</p>
<p>
“She’s a very sweet and lovely girl, Harry,”
she replied. “But she isn’t the sort you should
choose for a companion.”
</p>
<p>
At the words, the boy looked up quickly at his
aunt and what he read in her face made him flush.
</p>
<p>
“I mean, she is very rich and I think—that is,
I have heard—her family intend her to marry
Elmer Craven.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s rich, too, isn’t he?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
Deeply did it grieve the good woman to speak
the words she had, but she believed it would be
best for her nephew to realize the social difference
that existed between Viola and himself, that he
might be spared the humiliation and embarrassment
in the future. Though they allowed their
daughter to attend the Rivertown High School,
the Darrows were proud and arrogant people and
always did all in their power to prevent the girl
from mingling with her schoolmates.
</p>
<p>
But though Mrs. Watson strove to offset the
sting of her statement, the rest of the dinner was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
eaten in comparative silence, and Harry set out
for school with a heavy heart.
</p>
<p>
Not far had he proceeded up the main street,
however, before he caught sight of a form he
recognized as that of the bully who had been the
ringleader in the trick which had so nearly ended
in a tragedy.
</p>
<p>
“Hope he won’t come up and try to smooth
things over,” said Harry to himself. But the
next moment, his anxiety on this score was allayed.
</p>
<p>
Pud was busy making snowballs and storing
them under his arm.
</p>
<p>
“Wonder if he’s going to vent his disappointment
on me,” mused Harry, taking his hands from
his pockets that he might be ready to return the
bombardment, should the bully open on him.
</p>
<p>
Yet when he saw the bully’s victim, Harry’s
anger at the fellow was greater than ever.
</p>
<p>
As the new student passed a cross street, he
saw Pud jump behind a tree and then, peering
from one side, hurl one of the half dozen snowballs
he had under his arm.
</p>
<p>
Turning to see at whom they were aimed,
Harry was amazed to behold a bent and aged
man, hobbling along the sidewalk with the aid of
a cane.
</p>
<p>
The snowball knocked the cane from the man’s
hand and as it fell, the aged cripple tottered.
</p>
<p>
With an exclamation of disgust, Harry rushed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
up behind the bully and, seizing his arm, jerked
it so that the remaining snowballs fell to the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>
The thought that anyone had seen his cowardly
act in snowballing the aged man shamed the bully,
but only for the moment.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean by that?” he demanded,
fiercely, whirling round to face the interrupter of
what he considered his sport. And as he beheld
the boy who had brought disgrace upon him in the
morning, his face grew white with anger. “Oh,
it’s <em>you</em>, is it?” he went on. “Who do you think
you are, anyhow? Just because you couldn’t steer
the sled and went over the embankment is no reason
why you should think you are so much!”
</p>
<p>
“You know I could steer that sled, and only
went between the posts to keep from running into
the girls,” returned Harry. “But that has nothing
to do with the present matter. You ought to
be ashamed of yourself, to throw snowballs at an
old man!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, nobody cares about old Jed Brown!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you can’t snowball him when I’m
round!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, is that so? Who’s going to stop me, I
should like to know?”
</p>
<p>
“I am.”
</p>

<span class='caption'>HARRY RUSHED UP BEHIND THE BULLY AND SEIZED HIS ARM.</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>
“You?” And, after standing for several
seconds, during which he looked Harry over from
the top of his head to his feet, the bully burst into
laughter. “So <em>you</em>, whom I could pick up and
carry on one finger, are going to stop my doing
anything I want to, eh? That <em>is</em> a good one.
Why, kiddo, there is enough of me to make three
of you and then some.”
</p>
<p>
The tone in which Pud spoke sent the color
flushing to Harry’s face.
</p>
<p>
“Where I come from, it isn’t so much the size
that counts as it is the heart!” he retorted. “And
a fellow who will snowball an aged man can’t
have very much real heart!”
</p>
<p>
An instant the bully glowered at Harry, then
made a rush toward him.
</p>
<p>
“You’re getting altogether too fresh, young
feller!” he hissed. “Because of you, I’m getting
into all sorts of trouble—and I’m not going to
stand it! If I want to snowball or do anything
else to old Jed Brown, I’m going to, understand?”
And as though to give more force to his words,
Pud stooped down to pick up one of the missiles
the new student had knocked from his arm.
</p>
<p>
Before he could reach it, however, Harry threw
out his foot and crushed the snowball, then with
more quick movements demolished the others.
</p>
<p>
Never had anyone so thwarted the Rivertown
bully before and, for the moment, the big hulk of
a boy stood gazing at his discomfiter in amazement.
But only for a moment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
With a snarl, he shook his fist under Harry’s
nose.
</p>
<p>
“You seem to be looking for trouble—and
now you’re going to get it!”
</p>
<p>
Though the bully was much larger than Harry,
the latter did not cower before him.
</p>
<p>
So engrossed had the boys been in their quarrel
that they had failed to notice the approach of
Principal Larmore. But he made his presence
known just as Pud drew back his arm to strike.
</p>
<p>
“Snooks, go about your business!” he exclaimed.
“I’m ashamed to think you should seek
to pick a quarrel with the very boy who prevented
your trick with the sled from having a very serious
ending!”
</p>
<p>
As Harry had said, the bully was a coward at
heart, and growling to himself, he slunk away.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—SOCKER’S PLOT</h2>
<p>
With an amused smile, Mr. Larmore watched
Pud as he slouched off up the street.
</p>
<p>
“Rather a strenuous introduction to Rivertown,
you’re having, Watson,” he exclaimed,
pleasantly. “Do you mind telling me what Snooks
was saying to you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir; I do. It was only a personal matter.”
</p>
<p>
Fate, however, decreed that the principal should
learn the cause of the quarrel he had interrupted.
</p>
<p>
First with surprise, then with thankfulness, Jed
Brown had beheld Harry’s intervention—for the
aged man, veteran though he was, and bearing the
mark of his service for his country in a crippled
leg, was considered fair sport by many of the
young people in the village, and he was not accustomed
to having anyone champion him.
</p>
<p>
Consequently, when he had seen the school bully
threaten Harry, he had hobbled toward the pair
as fast as he could, only to arrive just as Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
Larmore had asked concerning the cause of the
trouble.
</p>
<p>
“It was about me, Mr. Larmore, sir, the fuss
was,” declared Jed. “Snooks was throwing
snowballs at me and this young man stopped him.”
Then, turning to Harry, he continued: “I’ll not
forget your kindness, my boy. My name is Jed
Brown.” And he extended a trembling hand.
</p>
<p>
“I’m Harry Watson,” smiled the boy, as he
shook hands.
</p>
<p>
“You ain’t any relation to Amos Watson, of
Lawrenceburgh, are you?” inquired the veteran,
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“He’s my father.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, well, well!” exclaimed Jed, excitedly,
again shaking the boy’s hand. “I’ve known Amos
ever since he was knee high to a grasshopper, and
there ain’t a finer man in this state, Mr. Larmore.
Harry, whenever your skates need sharpening
or you feel lonesome, just come around to see
me; I live in a little one-story house down at the
end of this street. You can’t miss it.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, I—” then, chancing to glance
down the street, the boy caught a glimpse of Pud
as he poked his head cautiously from behind a
tree-trunk, evidently with the purpose of finding
out where the veteran was, and he changed his
words, saying, “I guess I’ll walk along with you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
now. I have a knife that needs sharpening badly
and I can leave it with you.”
</p>
<p>
The principal had also seen the bully’s action
and he readily understood that Harry had made
his knife the excuse for walking home with the
old man, that he might protect him from any
further attack by Snooks. Yet he feared the bully
might waylay the boy and, as the other two set
out, fell into step beside them, much to the embarrassment
of both.
</p>
<p>
Arrived at Jed’s house which, though small, was
spick and span in appearance, Harry gave him his
knife, and after promising to call for it the next
afternoon, continued on his way to the school with
Mr. Larmore.
</p>
<p>
The detour which they had made to escort the
veteran to his home caused them to be a trifle
late in reaching the schoolhouse, and Harry was
very glad that none of the scholars were outside
to see him walking with the principal, for he
feared it might give them the impression that he
was a “teacher’s boy.”
</p>
<p>
But when he entered his classroom, he was the
centre of all eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Grandstand play!” growled Elmer to Socket.
“He’s got a swelled head, already, because he
steered the sled over the bank. Anybody with
any decency wouldn’t have waited until school
was in session before he came in.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
“Never mind, we’ll take him down a bit!”
returned Elmer Craven’s chum. “Just wait till
after school!”
</p>
<p>
The eye of the instructor chancing to wander
in their direction, the two boys buried their heads
in their books; and Elmer was forced to forego
asking his chum what scheme he was thinking out.
</p>
<p>
But when school was over for the day, he
quickly learned.
</p>
<p>
“Play hockey, Watson?” asked Socker, joining
a group of boys who had gathered about
Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Then come on down to the river and we’ll
have a game.”
</p>
<p>
“It will depend upon whether my trunk has
arrived or not. If it hasn’t come since I was at
aunt’s for dinner, I won’t be able to play because
my skates are in it.”
</p>
<p>
“I have an extra pair at the house you can
take,” interposed Paul. “The rest of you fellows
go down to the river; and Harry and I’ll join you
as soon as we can.” And falling into step beside
the boy who was soon to become his crony, Paul
Martin started down the hill which had been the
scene of the memorable incident in the morning.
</p>
<p>
To his delight, Harry found that his trunk had
arrived, and it was but the matter of a very few
minutes for him to open it and take out his skates.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
</p>
<p>
At the river, they found a merry crowd of boys
and girls, and quickly Harry and Paul sat down
to put on their skates.
</p>
<p>
“Now Sam, you go over and bring Mr. Watson
back with you as soon as he’s got his skates on,”
commanded Viola, who, with Nettie, had been
keeping a lookout for the boy whom she had been
unable to meet in the forenoon.
</p>
<p>
None too willingly, the fellow started, but before
he could reach Harry, the boy was on his feet,
and hockey stick in hand, was skimming over the
ice to where those who were to play were lined
up, some quarter of a mile up the river.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t that provoking!” pouted Viola, as she
noted his action. “But I’m going to meet Harry
Watson—even if I have to introduce myself.
Come on, Nettie, let’s skate over and watch the
game.”
</p>
<p>
With the arrival of Harry and Paul, Socker
exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Watson, you’ll play on Jerry’s team. Let’s
get the game started as soon as we can. It’ll be
dark before long.”
</p>
<p>
Quickly the boys took their positions, and Socker
and Elmer noticed with delight that the boy
who had incited their enmity was playing “rover.”
</p>
<p>
After the puck was put in play, it was dribbled
back and forth; then, as Paul noticed Harry was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
keeping well out to one side, he shot the rubber
to him.
</p>
<p>
Nursing it carefully, he dashed in, that he might
have a less difficult angle from which to try for
goal.
</p>
<p>
“Get him! Block him! Don’t let him score!”
cried Socker to his team-mates, and with a rush
they skated down upon Harry with tremendous
momentum.
</p>
<p>
For several moments, Jerry watched the strange
play of his opponents—for they had left their positions
uncovered; then it dawned on him what
their purpose was and he charged down to Harry’s
rescue, at the same time shouting:
</p>
<p>
“Shoot it across, Watson! Shoot it across!”
</p>
<p>
With a deft twist of his wrist, Harry sent the
rubber spinning over the ice just in front of Socker
and his players.
</p>
<p>
But instead of checking themselves and going
after it, they continued straight at the new student.
</p>
<p>
Surprised, but believing that their speed was
such that they were unable to turn quickly, Harry
grinned at them, wheeled on his right skate with
a suddenness that would have done a professional
proud, and sought to go around them.
</p>
<p>
Clever as was his move, however, it came too
late.
</p>
<p>
With terrific force, Socker, Elmer and another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
boy crashed into him—and as they all went down,
there was a resounding whack.
</p>
<p>
“Pretty raw work, Craven!” snapped Jerry,
as he caught the richest boy in Rivertown High
School by the collar and jerked him off the pile.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
Jerry, however, was too engrossed in the task
of getting the others off Harry to reply.
</p>
<p>
But when he had succeeded, the new high school
scholar lay on his back, motionless.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—HARRY SHOWS HIS GRIT</h2>
<p>
Abashed at the sight of the boy lying white
and still on the ice, the other hockey players gazed
at one another.
</p>
<p>
“He’s shamming!” growled Elmer.
</p>
<p>
“You know better than that!” retorted Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“That you and Socker deliberately ran into
Watson—and you know it as well as I do!”
</p>
<p>
“I saw Socker give him the knee!” interposed
Paul.
</p>
<p>
Intense was the feeling between the two teams,
and instinctively the boys who had been playing
lined up with their respective captains. But before
the argument became more bitter, Harry
opened his eyes, gazed about him in a dazed
manner, and then sat up.
</p>
<p>
“Got a bit of a knock, didn’t I?” he smiled.
“I say, did I score a goal?”
</p>
<p>
At the question, all the boys turned to look toward
the net of Socker’s team, having forgotten in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
their excitement to notice where the puck had
gone.
</p>
<p>
“Jove, but you did!” cried Paul. “Good boy,
Harry!”
</p>
<p>
Instantly the other members of the team with
which Harry was playing took up the cry and
Elmer and his companions skated away to hide
their chagrin.
</p>
<p>
“Here comes Longback; we can put him in,
and you can get out of the game!” exclaimed
Paul, helping Harry to his feet.
</p>
<p>
“Not much—that is, if you are willing I should
keep on playing,” returned Harry. “I’m all
right now; and I should like to show those other
fellows that I’m not a pillow!”
</p>
<p>
“But can you stand the handling?” asked Jerry,
anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Leave it to me—I’m no rag-doll,” retorted
Harry. “If they are up to any tricks, I know a
thing or two!”
</p>
<p>
The gameness of the new student appealed to
all the members of the team on which he was
playing, and without further comment they lined
up for the next play.
</p>
<p>
Surprised to see Harry still in the line-up,
Socker skated over to Elmer and held a brief
consultation with him, but their whisperings were
interrupted by the puck being put into play.
</p>
<p>
As luck would have it, the rubber was sent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
straight toward Elmer and, with a clever stop,
he dribbled it along toward Harry, evidently
thinking that he would be able to pass him easily
because of his seemingly dazed condition.
</p>
<p>
But Harry realized his purpose and, with a
burst of speed, he rushed in, snatched the puck,
steadied his stick—and then drove it spinning toward
the goal net, sending it past the tender.
</p>
<p>
“Good boy!” shouted his team-mates. And
the cheer was immediately taken up by the boys
and girls who had gathered to watch the game.
</p>
<p>
Smarting more under the thought that the fellow
they had sought to humiliate had succeeded
in turning the tables against them than in the fact
that their opponents had scored two goals, Socker
called his men about him.
</p>
<p>
“Play for Watson!” he cried through clenched
teeth. “That fellow’s got to have his big head
taken off him!”
</p>
<p>
“Ready!” called the lad who was acting as
umpire; and with set teeth, Socker’s men took
their positions.
</p>
<p>
Straight and true for the goal Paul sent the
puck, but Snooks checked it just in time to prevent
another score, and cleverly Elmer took the rubber
through the opposing players until only Harry
stood between him and the man at the net.
</p>
<p>
Gritting his teeth, the new member of the Rivertown
High School determined to show that he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
an offensive as well as a defensive player. With
a terrific rush, he bore down on Elmer Craven,
and with a sudden twist of his stick, tripped the
fellow, grabbed the rubber, dribbled it out of
reach, then sent it spinning with a force that drove
it through the net!
</p>
<p>
Loud were the shouts from the onlookers—but
Elmer lay still and quiet.
</p>
<p>
“You hit him in the head with your stick!”
growled Socker, starting toward Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense! <em>I</em> play a clean game! Leave it
to me—I’ll bring him round in a jiffy!”
</p>
<p>
And while the others stood inactive, Harry
scraped up some ice with his skate and rubbed
the shavings on Craven’s face.
</p>
<p>
“Who’s doing that?” demanded the boy, sitting
up.
</p>
<p>
But his only answer was a general laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Everybody ready, puck’s going to be put in
play!” shouted the umpire, and without delay,
the boys took their positions.
</p>
<p>
“You want to watch out, the whole team will
be down on you this time!” warned Jerry to
Harry, but the lad only laughed.
</p>
<p>
“I reckon I can give them as good as they
send,” he replied. “It just took me a few minutes
to get onto their game. I——”
</p>
<p>
But his words were interrupted by the play.
</p>
<p>
While Snooks caught the rubber and started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
back with it, all the other members of the team
bore down on Harry.
</p>
<p>
Not seeming to notice them, the boy hurried to
the assistance of the goal tender, his pursuers in
full cry. Then, with a suddenness that caused the
scholars on the side lines to gasp, Harry turned,
shoved his stick between the skates of the fellow
nearest him, and sent him sprawling on the ice,
causing the others to fall on top of him.
</p>
<p>
Loud was the laughter that rose from the boys
and girls who were not in the game, while Jerry
and Paul patted Harry on the back.
</p>
<p>
But several of the instructors happened to be
among the spectators and, realizing that the game
would soon be beyond the bounds of sport, they
intervened.
</p>
<p>
“Vhy not ve all go and get kindling voods
for a bonfire dis efening?” shouted Prof. Schmidt,
the genial German professor.
</p>
<p>
“Yes! Yes! Get wood for a bonfire!” cried
the boys and girls on the side lines; and forgetful
of the hockey game, they skated across the ice,
effectually putting an end to the contest.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—THE RACE ON SKATES</h2>
<p>
In thorough good humor on account of their
winning the hockey game, Paul and Jerry called
Harry, and together they started up the river to
where a big pile of brush lay on the bank.
</p>
<p>
In full cry, a score or more of the other boys
and girls, among whom were Viola and Nettie,
set after them, calling to them to wait. But the
three boys only checked their speed slightly.
</p>
<p>
“Come on. A race for the brush-pile,” shouted
Longback. “I’ll wager hot soda for the bunch
of us that I’ll be the first one to reach it.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re on! You’re on!” shouted a dozen of
the boys, among whom were Harry and his recent
team-mates.
</p>
<p>
And as the challenge was accepted, the boys
dashed away.
</p>
<p>
No more than a few yards had he gone, than
Elmer Craven shouted:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you Paul and Jerry! You’ve got the start
of the rest of us. Come back and line up.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
</p>
<p>
“No. This is as fair for one of us as it is for
another,” cried Pud, whose inordinate love for
soda caused him to exert himself to the utmost,
and during the checking of the speed as the result
of Craven’s suggestion, he had taken the lead.
</p>
<p>
“Sure you think it’s fair now, Pud,” laughed
Jerry, “so long as you’re ahead.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to come back and line up as Elmer
said or I won’t make good my offer,” declared
Longback.
</p>
<p>
At this ultimatum all the boys who had started
ahead checked themselves and then returned to
where the offerer of the prize had scratched a
mark on the ice.
</p>
<p>
With great good nature, laughing and joking
with one another, the boys lined up, Harry and his
two team-mates happening to be on the end where
Viola and Nettie were standing.
</p>
<p>
“Who’s going to give the word to start?” demanded
Snooks in a none too pleasant tone, for
he was disappointed at having had to give up the
lead which he had obtained over the others.
</p>
<p>
“I will,” cried Viola.
</p>
<p>
“That means Elmer’ll win,” declared Nettie.
</p>
<p>
“Why not let Prof. Schmidt start it?” suggested
some one.
</p>
<p>
Readily the genial professor consented; and
taking his position at the opposite end of the
line from where the two girls stood, he cried:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
</p>
<p>
“Eferybody get retty! You Schnooks, you
get back onto the line. Don’t try to shteal a
yard.”
</p>
<p>
Grumbling to himself, the boy obeyed.
</p>
<p>
“Now, vonce again. Eferybody retty! Von,
two, t’ree—<em>Go!</em>”
</p>
<p>
Eagerly the boys dashed forward and for a
few minutes they were all bunched together. Then
Elmer, Snooks, Longback and Harry dashed
ahead of the others, and for a few moments raced
neck and neck.
</p>
<p>
“Go it, Elmer!” “Go it Longback!” shouted
their partisans, and as though the good wishes of
their friends gave them greater speed, the two
boys forged ahead.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, why doesn’t somebody shout for Harry
Watson!” exclaimed Viola, stamping her foot.
</p>
<p>
“Going back on Elmer so soon,” chided several
of the girls who were with her. She made them
no reply, but instead, skating after the racers.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, we girls will have a race, and the
one who wins we’ll crown queen of the ice at the
bonfire to-night!” cried Nettie.
</p>
<p>
“Fine! Dandy!” chorused a dozen or so of
the girls, and one of them added:
</p>
<p>
“Let’s have a regular carnival, and we’ll make
the boy who wins king.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you start it, Prof. Schmidt?” asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
Viola, and again the genial old German complied,
sending the girls off in short order.
</p>
<p>
During the preliminaries Viola had kept her
eyes on the boys ahead, and it seemed to her as
if Harry cut down the lead of Elmer and Longback.
Instantly the thought occurred to her that
if no one would introduce her to the new student,
by winning the girl’s race, she would surely be
able to meet him at the mock coronation ceremony
planned for the carnival. And, gritting her teeth,
she bent forward, skating with all the speed she
could summon.
</p>
<p>
After the start of the girls, the interest of the
spectators had again turned to the boys and, that
they might the better see the finish, everyone
skated in the direction of the brush-pile.
</p>
<p>
When Snooks saw Harry taking the lead he
grew furious.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll get him! If I can’t win, <em>he</em> certainly
shan’t,” he growled to himself, and his anger at
the boy who had so humiliated him on two occasions
giving him increased strength, he quickly cut
down Watson’s lead, although in doing so, he
swerved his course from the extreme opposite
end of the line of racers close over to that of
the boy for whom he had conceived such hatred.
</p>
<p>
“What’s Pud up to?” exclaimed several of
those who were following. But not long was the
bully’s purpose in doubt. Tiring from his burst
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
of speed when he was almost abreast of Harry,
realizing that if he were to carry out his mean
scheme he must act immediately, he lunged
viciously towards the new student.
</p>
<p>
“Watch out, Watson! Snooks is trying to
foul you!” shouted Jerry.
</p>
<p>
The warning was unnecessary, because Harry
had heard the sharp strokes of the skates close
to him, and, although he did not check his speed
by looking around, he intuitively seemed to realize
that the approach of the skater boded him no
good; and, just as the bully sought to throw him
off his balance, he turned his skate out and shot
rapidly to one side, putting himself a scant foot
beyond Snook’s reach.
</p>
<p>
“Pretty work! Good boy!” shouted the spectators,
as they realized the bully’s attempt and
our hero’s escape.
</p>
<p>
But his move had taken Harry several yards
out of his course, and quick were Elmer and
Longback to improve the opportunity to wrest
the lead from him. Clenching his fists more tightly,
Harry bent lower, and exerted himself to the
utmost to recover the lost ground. Less than one
hundred yards away was the brush-pile, and a
stick held in front of the racers would have
touched each one, so even were they.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you Elmer! Get a move on! They’re
going to have a carnival and crown the winner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
king. The girls are racing to be queen, and
Viola’s leading!” shouting one of the scholars.
</p>
<p>
Thus apprised for the first time of the additional
plans which had been made for the bonfire,
the three boys bent themselves to still greater
efforts.
</p>
<p>
To Elmer, the thought that Harry might win
and thus share the honor of participating in the
mock ceremony with Viola was bitter indeed.
</p>
<p>
“If there was no one else but Longback, I
wouldn’t care,” he told himself. “But I can’t
let that scrub play king when Viola is queen.”
</p>
<p>
Nearer and nearer to the finish the three boys
sped, amid the yells and cheers of advice and encouragement
their partisans hurled at them.
</p>
<p>
But though each of the trio was skating with
might and main, not one of them seemed able to
gain on the others—and the brush-pile was a
scant fifty yards away.
</p>
<p>
“Shake ’em, Elmer! Shake ’em, Watson!”
cried the spectators, according to their preference.
</p>
<p>
But another ten yards were cut from the distance
to go, and Elmer and Harry were still
abreast, having gained slightly on Longback.
</p>
<p>
With a sudden burst of speed Elmer forged
ahead, amid the cheers of his supporters, but
even as the air was rent by their shouts of “Elmer
wins!” their hopes were dashed.
</p>
<p>
With no warning, the rich boy gave a sudden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
lurch towards Watson, struggled desperately to
recover himself, then fell to the ice, sliding with
terrific force toward Harry.
</p>
<p>
At the sight, the boys and girls who were following
cried out in surprise and disappointment,
while Jerry and Paul shouted warnings to their
new friend.
</p>
<p>
“That’ll finish Watson as well as Elmer,” declared
one student.
</p>
<p>
But his prophecy was not to be fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
When he heard the shouts of warning, Harry
had turned his head to learn their cause just in
time to see Craven’s body come sliding toward
him over the ice with amazing speed.
</p>
<p>
Realizing that, should it hit him, he, too, would
be knocked down, and the race go to the boy
whom they had both outskated, Harry took a
desperate chance and jumped, clearing Elmer’s
shoulder by a few inches.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—THE GIRLS’ RACE</h2>
<p>
Harry’s action was greeted with shouts of approval
by all the scholars, but just when it seemed
that he was going to win without further mishap,
he fell and Longback flashed across the line a
winner!
</p>
<p>
In landing after his jump, Harry had leaned
too far forward, with the result that, though he
strove desperately to keep his balance, his centre
of equilibrium was too far forward, and he pitched
onto his face.
</p>
<p>
Little time did the fellows have to discuss the
eventful race, when there sounded a cry: “Get
out of the way! Give the girls a chance to
finish!”
</p>
<p>
Quickly the crowd that had surrounded the
fallen skaters, moved out of the way, as the girls
bore down upon the imaginary line that marked
the end of the race. Bent far down, her arms
swinging like well regulated pistons, Viola was
in the lead, a good three yards separating her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
from her nearest antagonist, Mildred Evans,
while almost an equal distance behind Mildred,
the rest of the girls were bunched.
</p>
<p>
His disappointment over his fall forgotten in
the thought that Longback had snatched victory
from the boy to whom he had taken such a
dislike, Elmer cried:
</p>
<p>
“Look out for that crack in the ice, Viola, or
you’ll get tripped just as I did.”
</p>
<p>
Although the girl heard the warning, she gave
no evidence, either by thanks or by action, and
could the richest boy of Rivertown High School
have known what was passing in her mind, he
would have worn anything but the pleased smile
that enveloped his face.
</p>
<p>
So long as Harry had been in the lead, Viola
had exerted herself to the utmost to leave the
girls with whom she was racing as far behind
as she could. With a little gasp of dismay, she
had seen Snooks’ desperate but futile attempt to
foul Harry, and when the boy had jumped over
Elmer, she had been one of those who had shouted
their delight, and corresponding was her disappointment
when Harry himself fell, and Longback
won.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll not be queen to Longback’s king!” exclaimed
the proud girl, indignantly, yet, aware
as she was of the lead she had over the others in
the race, she was puzzled to know how she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
manage to lose it without her purpose being too
evident.
</p>
<p>
When she heard Elmer’s warning, however,
she realized that there was a crack in the ice
which would throw her. Quickly she formed her
plans, and, with almost imperceptible slackening
in her speed, she began to search the ice for the
crevice.
</p>
<p>
For several seconds she was unable to discern
it; then of a sudden her glance fell upon a zigzag
depression, and she changed her course, though
ever so slightly, that she might be the more sure
to strike it.
</p>
<p>
“Look out! Look out! Keep away from
that edge of the bank!” shouted Elmer and several
of his companions. But as unheeding as
before, the girl kept on, appeared to stagger a
moment as she struck the depression, and then
sank to the ice.
</p>
<p>
First, in blank dismay, and then in anger, the
rich boy who had seemed to be the favored one
among Viola’s friends stared at her, and finally,
with a mumbled exclamation, skated toward her.
</p>
<p>
“You did that on purpose!” he snarled, as,
stooping over, he took hold of Viola’s arm to
assist her to her feet.
</p>
<p>
At the words, the blood flushed hotly to the
girl’s cheeks and indignantly she wrenched her
arm from Elmer’s grasp.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
“How dare you say such a thing to me, Elmer
Craven!” she exclaimed angrily. “Even if I
have sprained my ankle, I am quite capable of
getting up by myself,” and forthwith she proceeded
so to do.
</p>
<p>
In the excitement caused by Viola’s fall, coming
as it did after the two leaders in the boys’
race had been put out of the running by similar
accidents, those who had been watching the girls’
race were too absorbed in their efforts to urge on
their favorites, now that all had practically an
even chance of winning, for, in her endeavor not
to meet a similar mishap to Viola, Mildred had
skated so far to one side that she had lost the
lead, so that none of them had seen the trick
save Nettie and Harry.
</p>
<p>
Both of them, however, were too far away to
hear what passed between the boy and girl, but
as Nettie saw her chum limp when she tried to
skate after picking herself up, she gave up the
race and went to her assistance.
</p>
<p>
“What is it? Have you hurt yourself?” she
asked, solicitously.
</p>
<p>
“It’s my ankle. I’m afraid I’ve sprained it.”
</p>
<p>
“Really?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be a goose.”
</p>
<p>
A moment the girl gazed at her chum and then
the light of understanding coming to her, she
exclaimed, significantly:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” And the better to give the semblance
of truth to the supposed injury, she put her arm
around Viola to support her, and led her to the
bank, where she sat down on a tree stump.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the race had been won by
Annabel Hutchins, who was known among her
classmates as the infant prodigy, because being
precociously bright, she had entered the freshman
class when she was only thirteen years old.
</p>
<p>
For a moment after the tall, awkward girl
skated across the line in the lead of the others,
there was a silence. And then, as the humor of
the situation dawned upon the others, for Longback,
a member of the senior class, had the
proper contempt for the under classmen, the boys
and girls yelled and cheered frantically.
</p>
<p>
“This will be some coronation!” cried Socker,
with a grin. But some of the girl’s, noting Annabel’s
embarrassment, prevented any more such remarks
by surrounding her and skating her to the
brush-pile. Then quickly seizing some of the
dried branches, they started down the river with
them toward the spot where the bonfire was to
be built.
</p>
<p>
The boys, however, especially the freshmen,
found it too great an opportunity to tease the
haughty senior, and they made his life so miserable
with their comment that in a rage he skated
away by himself.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—THE RIVALRY BETWEEN HARRY AND ELMER</h2>
<p>
Their victim, having thus put himself beyond
their torment, the other boys turned to the brush-pile,
and each taking as many branches as he
could carry skated down the river.
</p>
<p>
Viola and Nettie were still on the stump, and
only Paul, Jerry and Harry were left at the
brush-pile.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t suppose Miss Darrow hurt herself
so badly she can’t skate back, do you?” asked
Harry of his companions.
</p>
<p>
“Jove! I hadn’t thought of that,” returned
Paul, and skating over to where the two girls
were, he asked concerning the extent of Viola’s
injuries.
</p>
<p>
“She’s hurt her ankle,” explained Nettie.
</p>
<p>
“My! that’s bad. Can you skate on it at all?”
inquired Paul.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t skate on it, but I may be able to step
on it,” dissembled Viola, and getting to her feet,
started to walk, only to sink down with a little cry
of well-feigned pain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
</p>
<p>
“Jerry and Harry, come over here! Viola’s
hurt her ankle, and we’ve got to get her back
down the river some way,” called Paul to his
chums.
</p>
<p>
“Remember we haven’t met Mr. Watson!”
exclaimed Nettie in a low voice, as the two boys
left the brush-pile and skated toward them.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I’m glad you reminded me. I’d forgotten,”
murmured Paul, and when the new student
joined them, he was quickly introduced.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to go down the river and get a
sled for you, Viola,” announced Jerry. “You
wait here with Nettie and Paul, and Harry and
I’ll go down.”
</p>
<p>
But after their manœuvring to meet Harry the
two girls did not propose to lose his companionship
so quickly, and Viola hurriedly exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“I think perhaps if you boys will help me, I
shall be able to walk down.”
</p>
<p>
“But that will only make your ankle worse,
Miss Darrow,” declared Harry. “I have it.
We’ll take a big pile of the brush and you and
Miss Masterson can sit on it and we will pull
you down the river.”
</p>
<p>
“The very thing!” cried the other boys, and
without more ado, they returned to the heap of
dried branches, picked out several big ones, which
they placed on the ice, heaping smaller ones
across them, until they had made a rustic nest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
into which the girls climbed, while the boys, with
pieces of rope which they had found and with
their skate straps, bound the heavy limbs together
and made a leash by which they could pull the
improvised sled.
</p>
<p>
But not without difficulty did the strange method
of transportation advance. First some of the
heavy limbs spread, letting the twigs and girls
down onto the ice and frequently were they
spilled from their nest, but all enjoyed it and with
much laughter and merry chatter they approached
the spot where the others were stacking the brush
which was to be set on fire in the evening.
</p>
<p>
“My eye! Look what’s coming!” shouted
Misery Jones, as he espied Viola and the others.
</p>
<p>
At his cry the rest of the boys and girls followed
the direction of his gaze, and when they
beheld the moving brush-heap with its two passengers,
they shouted and laughed as they skated up
to meet them.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Ach! die liebliche Schnee-fogeln!</em>” exclaimed
Prof. Schmidt, laughing as he caught sight of the
two pretty girls on the brush-pile. “Too bad it
iss dat wir de coronation not now can have?”
</p>
<p>
As he heard the words, Longback took a hasty
glance over the crowd assembled near the brush-pile,
and not seeing Annabel, exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“That’s a good idea, Professor. It’s getting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
so dark that we can have the bonfire now just
as well as later.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no you don’t!” cried Misery. “You
can’t get out of the formal ceremony by one got
up on the spur of the moment. The real queen
who won the race, you know, might object and
cause you domestic unhappiness. Even kings are
allowed only one queen.”
</p>
<p>
The result of the boy’s protest was a lunge
from Longback’s hockey stick, from which he was
able to dodge back in the very nick-of-time.
</p>
<p>
But the haughty senior was not allowed to get
away with his caddish suggestion with only Misery’s
reproof.
</p>
<p>
“Now look here, Sam Dalton! No matter if
Annabel Hutchins is a freshy she won the race,
and she’s going to be crowned queen when you’re
crowned king!” exclaimed several of the older
girls, gathering about Longback. “You wouldn’t
have made any objection, you know, if it had
been Viola, or even Nettie, and they’re only freshmen,
too; so if you don’t want to regret it all
the rest of the time you’re in Rivertown High
School, you’ll be just as nice to Annabel as you
possibly can be. The poor child went home crying
because she thought we were all laughing at
her.”
</p>
<p>
“If it’s going to make so much trouble, what’s
the use of having the mock ceremony at all?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
exclaimed Elmer, seeking to come to the aid of
his chum.
</p>
<p>
“That’s it! Be a spoil sport!” cried several
of the boys and girls.
</p>
<p>
“Then I’ll resign my honor in favor of any
of you who desire it,” growled Longback.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s not have the bonfire at all,” exclaimed
Viola, flashing a look of contempt at the senior.
“Instead let’s go on a hay ride to Cardell—I’m
sure I can have the horses.”
</p>
<p>
“Good! We’ll take along Nettie’s and Socker’s
mothers and then we can have a dance at the
Lake House!” exclaimed Paul.
</p>
<p>
The suggestion met with instant approval.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s have a great big sleigh-ride,” Socker
exclaimed. “I guess father will let me take our
horses, too, and we can fix up with hay, and it will
be a great lark.”
</p>
<p>
“You all can do as you please,” declared Viola,
“but I want Jerry and Paul and Nettie and
Mildred and Sally and Elise and Dorothy and
Mr. Watson and Misery and Jack and Horace
and Annabel to be members of my party.”
</p>
<p>
Readily the boys and girls accepted, and their
hostess requested them to gather at her house at
eight o’clock. The omission of Elmer, Longback
and Socker from her guests caused looks of
amazement to be exchanged between the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
boys and girls, while the three fellows themselves
blushed.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll take the rest of our gang!” Socker exclaimed.
“We’ll go up to Cardell, anyhow, and
have a dance, and Viola, if you want to bring
your little friends, we should be very pleased to
see both you and them.”
</p>
<p>
“Will everybody whom I’ve invited go?”
asked the proud girl, ignoring the remark.
</p>
<p>
One after another they accepted until it came
to Harry, and he said, mindful of what his aunt
had told him:
</p>
<p>
“I thank you very much, Miss Darrow. I
should like to go, but I’m afraid it will be necessary
for me to stay at home and study.”
</p>
<p>
“Wow! Wow! Listen to that!” moaned Misery.
“On top of saving the kids and beating
Pud’s hockey team, he’s a grind!” and skating
over to the new student, he felt of his shoulders,
murmuring “It’s just as I thought. I can feel
his wings sprouting. My, won’t Rivertown get
a reputation when people know we’ve got an
angel among the freshies.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, if he stays in school until he’s a senior,
there won’t be any angel left about him,” laughed
Jerry. “Come on, Harry, you can go just as
well as not. The only thing we have to-morrow,
beside drawing and rhetoric, is Latin, and Old
Grouch Plummer always flunks everybody in that,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
so it isn’t worthwhile to study the lesson. Besides,
we want to initiate you into the delights
of the dancing floor at the Lake House, it’s——”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he doesn’t dance,” sneered Elmer.
“I’ve always heard that a lot of people down at
Lawrenceburgh were opposed to dancing, and
maybe Watson’s family is among them.”
</p>
<p>
This utterly uncalled-for slur made even the
rich boy’s chums look at him in amazement, but
though Harry flushed hotly, the darkness concealed
his confusion, and he replied in a steady
voice:
</p>
<p>
“I’m very fond of dancing, but really, Miss
Darrow, I must decline your invitation.” And
quickly wishing his friends among the boys and
girls “good-night,” he skated over to the bank,
took off the ice-runners, and went home.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—PAUL’S PARTY</h2>
<p>
The real reason for Harry’s declination of the
invitation to form one of the merry party, was
the fact that he knew there would be necessarily
some expense attached to the dance, and his
circumstances were such that he was obliged to
watch his money carefully. Indeed, it had only
been at a distinct personal sacrifice that his father
had been able to arrange for the boy to go to
Rivertown High School. Aware of this fact,
he realized that it would not be right for him to
start out by associating with those whose parents
were in a position to give them liberal allowances
for spending money.
</p>
<p>
For a few moments after Harry’s abrupt departure
there was a silence among the boys and
girls who were planning the sleighing party and
dance.
</p>
<p>
“There’s no use in allowing a new freshy to
interfere with our fun,” Socker exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who’s going and who isn’t? I want to know,
so that I can get the horses and the sled and the
hay ready.”
</p>
<p>
The others sided in with this view of the matter,
and arrangements for meeting were quickly
made, after which the boys and girls separated,
going to their respective homes.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you think that was queer in Harry
Watson to decline your invitation, Viola?” asked
Nettie, as they walked along.
</p>
<p>
Before the girl could answer, however, a voice
behind them exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“He hasn’t got money enough to go, or to do
anything the rest of us can. Father says he
knows Watson’s father and that he’s poorer than
a church mouse.”
</p>
<p>
Surprised to think their conversation had been
overheard, the girls turned quickly and beheld
Pud Snooks.
</p>
<p>
“Well, if that’s the real reason Mr. Watson
declined to go with us, it’s nothing to be ashamed
of. I’m sure it’s better not to go than to sponge
on some of the boys who have money,” sniffed
Viola. At this taunt, which was particularly
stinging for the reason that, although the bully’s
father had plenty of money, he gave his son very
little to spend, with the result that he was always
taking part in the pastimes of his schoolmates,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
and forcing his companions to pay his share,
Snooks growled to himself and slunk away.
</p>
<p>
For several minutes the two girls walked along
in silence.
</p>
<p>
“Well, if it is true that Harry Watson won’t
be able to go to our dances and things, I’m going
to be all the nicer to him at school and on the
ice, because I like him. Honestly, I do, Nettie,”
said Viola.
</p>
<p>
This frank avowal surprised her chum, but
she discreetly kept the fact to herself, and it was
not long before the unpleasant incident on the
ice was forgotten.
</p>
<p>
But it had made a deep impression upon Harry
and, when he arrived at the comfortable home of
his aunt he was very serious, returning her greeting
almost curtly.
</p>
<p>
Realizing that something was amiss with the
boy, yet knowing well that should she question
him about it, she would but add to his reticence,
the aunt wisely held her peace, trusting that
during the evening he would let her know what
the trouble was, of his own accord.
</p>
<p>
The boy, however, came to the conclusion that
the problem which confronted him was one that
he alone could work out; and, during supper, he
forestalled any possible inquiries on the part of
his aunt by relating to her the incidents of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
hockey game, and then the races to the brush-pile.
</p>
<p>
No sooner was the meal finished, however,
than he betook himself to his room on the plea
that he wished to unpack his trunk, and he was
soon busily engaged in so doing, at the same time
revolving plans in his mind by which he could
either win the good will of the boys who had
taken such an evident dislike to him, or else
manage in some way to get the best of them so
effectually that, for the future, they would not
seek to annoy him.
</p>
<p>
“I thought you were going to grind out your
Latin,” cried a voice, presently.
</p>
<p>
“Why, hello, Paul! I thought you were going
on the sleigh-ride!” returned Harry.
</p>
<p>
“None of our crowd are going, because Mrs.
Masterson wasn’t able to chaperone us to-night.
Instead we are going to have a candy-pull over
at my house, and I came over to get you. So
put your duds on and come along.”
</p>
<p>
At first our hero thought of refusing, then he
reconsidered his idea, and accompanied the fellow
who was later to be his most intimate chum to his
home, where he found all the boys and girls who
were to have been members of Viola’s sleighing
party, even to Annabel; and pleasant, indeed, was
the evening which he passed.
</p>
<p>
As they bade Paul’s mother and the boy good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
night and went out on the piazza, Mildred suddenly
cried:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, look at that red spot in the sky!”
</p>
<p>
Instantly the others turned in the direction
towards which the girl was gazing.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a fire!” exclaimed Misery. “It’s a bad
night for one, too, with the wind blowing, and it’s
so cold it will be hard to get any water.”
</p>
<p>
“Where is it? Why doesn’t someone give the
alarm?” exclaimed several of the boys and
girls.
</p>
<p>
“It’s over toward the bluff leading up to the
school.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it’s only a manifestation of the aurora
borealis!” exclaimed Annabel.
</p>
<p>
“That sounds fine, Annabel, but I guess I know
a fire when I see one,” returned Misery.
</p>
<p>
“But it’s just as likely to be the aurora as it
is a fire,” protested Mildred.
</p>
<p>
“No, it isn’t either,” retorted Misery. “It’s
a bad night, and fires always come on bad nights.”
</p>
<p>
The excited voices attracted the attention of
Paul’s father, and as the gentleman made his way
to the front door, several of them turned to him.
</p>
<p>
“Is that a fire, Mr. Martin?” they asked.
</p>
<p>
Ere the old gentleman could reply, however,
all doubt was put at rest by the shout of “Fire!”
followed almost immediately by the ringing of the
church bell.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Martin’s house was situated on the main
street, and as the members of the volunteer fire
company rushed by to get the hand engine, Paul’s
father called out:
</p>
<p>
“Where is it, boys?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s Jed Brown’s house,” came the answer.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—THE FALSE CHARGE</h2>
<p>
A fire in a small country village, always a
dread catastrophe, is much more serious in the
winter, especially when any wind is stirring; and
in the realization of these facts, the street was
soon alive with men and women hurrying to the
scene of the conflagration.
</p>
<p>
When they learned, however, that it was the
home of the crippled veteran, many of them
turned back.
</p>
<p>
All Paul’s friends, together with his father,
had started towards the scene, as soon as they
knew where the fire was; and as Mr. Martin
met several men whom he knew, returning, he
asked:
</p>
<p>
“Where are you going? Is the fire out, or
what?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it’s nothing but old Jed Brown’s shanty,”
retorted one of them.
</p>
<p>
“That doesn’t make any difference. You
ought to be willing to help Jed as quickly as anyone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
else. Besides, there’s quite a wind, and if we
don’t check the blaze, it may spread. Now turn
around and come back with me.”
</p>
<p>
As Mr. Martin was a person of importance
and influence in Rivertown, the men whom he
had stopped and ordered to go back quickly
obeyed.
</p>
<p>
When they arrived at the head of the street
whence they could see the veteran’s little house,
they all realized that it would be impossible to
save it, for, though it had been a short fifteen
minutes since the alarm had been sounded, the
house was a seething mass of flames.
</p>
<p>
Frantically men were working with shovels,
throwing the snow which they scooped up onto
the leaping tongues of fire, but without any result.
</p>
<p>
Rising high into the air, the sparks were borne
in all directions, and when an unusually strong
gust of wind swirled down the bluff, the burning
brands were carried from the doomed house.
</p>
<p>
“Where are the boys with the hand engine?”
demanded Mr. Martin, when no sight or sound
was there of the volunteer fire department.
“Aren’t they coming?”
</p>
<p>
“They’re stuck. One of the runners on the
front bob gave in,” informed a man who had
just joined the constantly-increasing fringe of men
and women whose figures stood out in prominent
silhouette against the lurid flames.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then we must get busy and form bucket
brigades to wet down the roofs of those two
houses right alongside!” exclaimed Mr. Martin,
pointing to two large white residences, one of
which was about one hundred feet from the burning
house, and the other almost directly across the
not over-wide street.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, men! If those houses catch, the
fire will sweep right through the town! A quarter
of an hour’s work now will save them; but
if we wait very long it will be too late.”
</p>
<p>
Aroused by the words of the town Nestor, the
men and boys lost no time in rushing to each of
the residences; and while some of them went into
the kitchens and manned the pumps, others
formed a line to pass the pails, which were contributed
by everybody; while others of the men
who had placed ladders against the eaves, mounted
the roof, where they sat astraddle of the ridgepole,
dousing the embers which were falling on
the roofs with greater frequency.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, the rumor spread among those still
watching the fire that the crippled veteran was in
his house.
</p>
<p>
Hysterical women wrung their hands and
begged the men to rush into the flames and rescue
the helpless man. Such an act, however, would
have been the height of folly, and none of them
made the attempt, knowing full well that were he
inside he would have met his death long before.
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<a name='i004' id='i004'></a>
<img src="images/illus-003.jpg" alt="OTHERS FORMED A LINE TO PASS THE PAILS." title=""/><br />
<span class='caption'>OTHERS FORMED A LINE TO PASS THE PAILS.</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>
The rumor, however, was dispelled almost as
quickly as it had started.
</p>
<p>
“Ha! Old Jed ain’t in the house! I seen him
sneaking off down the street just as soon as the
fire was going well,” exclaimed Pud.
</p>
<p>
“How long was that before the alarm was
given?” demanded several of the men, who had
heard the statement of the butcher’s son.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, five or ten minutes, I should say. It
seems funny to me that the house should burn
so quickly; and then I should have thought Jed
would have wanted to stay and watch it,” added
Pud.
</p>
<p>
Had the boy known, however, the purpose for
which the old veteran had gone down the street, he
would have been less active in trying to sow the
seeds of suspicion among those who were in earshot
of him. But in his ignorance he continued
to make statements that would cast suspicion upon
the old man.
</p>
<p>
“When I first seen the fire, I thought I smelled
kerosene.”
</p>
<p>
“So did I,” chorused several others.
</p>
<p>
This mention of the fact that they had noted
the odor of the combustible oil immediately started
the tongues of the women gossips to wagging;
and gathering into little groups, they began to talk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
over with one another the reasons the crippled
veteran would have for burning up his home.
</p>
<p>
The bully, however, had not finished his sensational
statements. No sooner had he seen that
his sowing of the seed of suspicion had found
ready soil, than he added to his previous effect
by saying:
</p>
<p>
“After I seen Jed and smelled the kerosene,
I went down around behind the house and seen
a fellow running. Seeing he was headed toward
the village I cut around back and followed him
while he walked up Kenosha street—and who do
you think it was?”
</p>
<p>
The highly excitable minds of the women and
the village gossips had been worked to concert
pitch by the bully, and as he paused dramatically
after his story, they cried:
</p>
<p>
“Who? Tell us, quick!”
</p>
<p>
Looking round from one to another of the
score of people who had gathered about him, the
bully exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“It was Harry Watson, the boy that’s come to
live here!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—HARRY IS EXONERATED</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately for Harry, he and his boy
and girl friends who had been at the Martins’
house during the evening were all scattered between
the two houses where the bucket brigades
were working, and no one was there to speak a
good word for him in contradiction of Snooks’
most despicable charge, for his manner as he
spoke gave no room to doubt that he believed
the new student had fired the building.
</p>
<p>
The others quickly put this interpretation upon
his statement, and with the rapidity only to be
found in villages, word spread about that Harry,
for some fancied spite, had burned up the home
of the crippled veteran.
</p>
<p>
And as the story was repeated, it lost nothing
in the telling.
</p>
<p>
“Why doesn’t someone go swear out a warrant
for the boy’s arrest?” demanded a particularly
irascible old woman.
</p>
<p>
“You can’t do it, Mirandy, unless you got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
some reason for making the charge, and you
didn’t see the boy,” returned one of the men.
</p>
<p>
“But Pud Snooks seen him. He can swear out
a warrant!” exclaimed the spinster. “It ought
to be done. There won’t be nobody safe in the
village with that boy liable to burn us all up at
any time.”
</p>
<p>
The words caused alarm among several of the
women, who gathered about the old gossip, and
they began to demand that action be taken; but
when some of the men finally started to look for
the bully who had spread the wicked report, he
was nowhere to be seen.
</p>
<p>
The gossips, however, interpreted Snooks’ absence
to their own ends.
</p>
<p>
“Some of the men have probably taken him
up to Squire Baxter’s,” said Miranda, and others
who had heard her words instantly gave the
irresponsible old spinster’s remark the stamp of
authority, declaring that Harry’s arrest was but
the question of a few minutes.
</p>
<p>
In the meanwhile, the fire having burnt itself
out on Jed Brown’s house, and the danger to the
neighboring mansions being thereby over, the
members of the bucket brigade made their way
once more to the scene of the conflagration.
</p>
<p>
With Mr. Martin on one side, and his son Paul
on the other, Harry approached the ruin.
</p>
<p>
“There he comes! There he comes! Luther
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
Martin has the little sneak! He knows what to
do with him!” snapped Miranda.
</p>
<p>
And in whispers, low but none the less audible,
the word quickly ran around the circle of gossips
that the village Nestor was holding the youthful
fire-bug until the proper authorities could take
him into custody. So curious were the glances
cast at them by the rest of the people, that Mr.
Martin could not help but notice them, and, wondering
at their cause, he turned to the man nearest
him, calling him by name, and asked:
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter, Zeke? Why is everybody
whispering and looking at me?”
</p>
<p>
“’Tain’t you they’re looking at,” returned the
man, in a voice as solemn as though he were chief
mourner at a funeral.
</p>
<p>
“Then who is it?”
</p>
<p>
“Harry Watson.”
</p>
<p>
“What about him?”
</p>
<p>
“You know as well as I do.”
</p>
<p>
Too familiar with his neighbors not to know
that something of unusual seriousness was afoot,
Mr. Martin laid his hand heavily upon Zeke’s
shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“I want you to tell me what people are saying
about Harry Watson, and what all this mysterious
whispering means?” declared the patriarchal
man in stern tones.
</p>
<p>
Realizing that it would be folly to try to deceive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
the village Nestor, Zeke looked uneasily
about him, then cleared his throat, preparatory
to speaking.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s this way, Luther,” he began in a
whining voice. “They are saying as how you’re
holding Harry Watson until the constable can
come and arrest him.”
</p>
<p>
Both Paul and the boy against whom the breath
of suspicion had been directed could not help
but hear what passed between Mr. Martin and
the man with whom he was talking, and as the
latter explained the action of the rest of the spectators,
Harry staggered back as though he had
been struck a blow in the face.
</p>
<p>
“Arrest me!” he exclaimed. “What for?”
</p>
<p>
“You know,” declared Zeke in a mournful
voice.
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense, Zeke. Nobody’s going to arrest
Harry Watson any more than they are me,” interrupted
Mr. Martin. “And now if you’ll just
get over your desire to create a mystery and tell
me what this is all about, I’ll quickly settle it—and
if you don’t, I’ll ask somebody who can tell
me the plain facts without any trimmings.”
</p>
<p>
Fond as he was of beating about the bush and
giving vague hints and meaning glances, rather
than a plain statement of facts, Zeke, however,
did not wish to be deprived of exploding the
bomb.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
</p>
<p>
“Pud Snooks says he seen young Watson running
away from the fire, and he and a lot of us
smelled kerosene just as the blaze started, and
Mirandy and the rest of us has been saying that
there won’t be any house safe in Rivertown until
that boy is fast behind lock and key.”
</p>
<p>
His son having told him during supper the
trick the bully had tried to play on Harry which
had come so near to resulting in the death of the
little children; also about the new student’s preventing
Pud from snowballing the crippled veteran,
and his attempt to foul the boy during the
race on the river, Mr. Martin readily realized
the story was but the emanation of the bully’s
brain.
</p>
<p>
Raising his voice so that it could be heard by
all within a radius of fifty feet, the village Nestor
exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“That’s utter nonsense, Zeke. Harry Watson
is a good boy. He comes from an honorable
family, and there’s no more reason for accusing
him of setting Jed Brown’s place afire than there
is of accusing me!” Then the patriarchal man
paused a few moments to allow the murmurs of
surprise to subside before he added in a still
louder voice than at first, for the greater effect:
</p>
<p>
“Besides, Harry Watson has been at my house
all the evening, and came to the fire together with
my boy, Paul, several of his friends, and myself.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
</p>
<p>
“But Pud said he seen him!” declared several
people, evidently unwilling to accept Mr. Martin’s
words.
</p>
<p>
“Where is Pud?” demanded the village Nestor.
“I——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, where is Pud Snooks? I want to talk
to him!” exclaimed a shrill voice, interrupting.
</p>
<p>
Turning at the sound, the men and women beheld
the bent and bowed form of old Jed Brown.
</p>
<p>
Instantly, there was a babel of talk and exclamations
at this unexpected turn in affairs.
</p>
<p>
“What do you want to see him for?” demanded
one of the men.
</p>
<p>
“I want to see him to ask him what he was
doing in my shed just before I caught him coming
out.”
</p>
<p>
At the words, several of the men and women
crowded about the crippled veteran, plying him
with questions; but with a wave of his hand, Mr.
Martin silenced them.
</p>
<p>
“This is a very serious statement, Jed,” he
exclaimed in a stern voice. “I warn you that you
must be careful what you say. Now tell me just
what happened, and how you discovered the fire.”
</p>
<p>
As they heard the words, those of the men
and women who were still at the scene, formed
a circle about the village patriarch and the crippled
veteran, necks craned forward, ears cocked,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
that they might not lose a syllable of anything
that was said.
</p>
<p>
“I was just getting ready to go to bed when
I heard a noise out in the shed,” declared Jed.
“For some time I’ve been missing tools, and so
I picked up a club I had by the kitchen stove,
and started out to see what the trouble was.
</p>
<p>
“I s’pose I made some noise, for just as I
had stepped out of the kitchen door, somebody
ran out from the shed and tried to pass me.
</p>
<p>
“‘Who is it?’ I cried. But instead of answering
me, the person swung at me and caught
me in the shoulder with a blow that would have
knocked me down had I not thrown my arms
about him and hung on.”
</p>
<p>
As he made this statement, the crippled veteran
paused. For several moments his auditors waited,
thinking he would continue, but when he did
not several of them asked:
</p>
<p>
“Did you see who it was?” “Could you get
a look at his face?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Who was it?”
</p>
<p>
“Pud Snooks!”
</p>
<p>
At the pronouncement of the bully’s name, cries
of astonishment arose from the circle of men and
women.
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you hold onto him?” demanded
Mr. Martin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
“Because he shook me off.”
</p>
<p>
“Then what did you do?”
</p>
<p>
“I started after him—and I hadn’t gone more
than half way up the street before I saw flames
burst from the shed.”
</p>
<p>
In silence all those in the circle heard these
words.
</p>
<p>
“Do you want to have the boy taken up for
this, Jed?” finally asked Mr. Martin.
</p>
<p>
“No. I don’t want to bring trouble to anyone,
but I’m not going to have the house burnt over
my head without getting some return. I want
to find Pud Snooks and ask him some questions,
and then I want to have a talk with his father.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re a sensible man, Jed,” declared Mr.
Martin. “Just come along with me and we will
go find Pud’s father. Come, Harry! Come,
Paul.”
</p>
<p>
Without more words Mr. Martin turned on his
heel, and led the way up the street, several of the
more curious among the crowd tagging at his
heels.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—“OLD GROUCH”</h2>
<p>
“I don’t believe it was Pud who set fire to Mr.
Brown’s house,” exclaimed Harry, as they walked
along.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you s’pose I know him when I see
him? I have good reason to!” retorted the
crippled veteran.
</p>
<p>
“What makes you think it wasn’t he, Harry?”
asked Mr. Martin.
</p>
<p>
“Because he was going on a sleigh ride with
Socker Gales and some of the other boys and
girls,” returned Harry.
</p>
<p>
“But evidently he didn’t go, for he was at
the fire after it was burning fiercely,” asserted
the venerable man. Nobody knew the cause for
the bully’s remaining at home.
</p>
<p>
Stung deeply by the words Nettie had uttered
when he had come up behind them when the two
girls were walking home, Snooks had asked his
father for some money that he might join his
friends in driving to the Lake House at Cardell
for the dance, only to be gruffly refused.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
</p>
<p>
Angry at his father, his friends and himself,
the bully had eaten his supper in sullen hastiness,
and then left the house by the back way for the
purpose of watching his friends depart on the
sleigh ride. The route he took, however, led
him past the house of the crippled veteran whom
he hated so deeply, and the sight of it suggested
to him that he might work off his ill-humor by
playing some trick on old Jed.
</p>
<p>
Entering the shed, he lighted a match and was
looking about the shop, when he had heard the
crippled veteran opening the door of the kitchen,
and, thinking only that he must escape, the boy
had thrown the match on the floor and rushed
to leave the shed. Instead of going out, the
match had fallen into a pile of shavings, quickly
igniting them, and the flames found ready food
in the pieces of wood, oil-soaked leather and other
odds and ends with which the shop was littered,
and in a few moments had gained such headway
that they were irresistible.
</p>
<p>
Such was the story which Mr. Martin and the
bully’s father extorted from the boy after they
had questioned him closely in the presence of the
crippled veteran for a half hour.
</p>
<p>
Though the fire was purely an accident, it was
so evident that Pud had gone to his arch-enemy’s
house bent on mischief, that the butcher and Mr.
Martin were at a loss how to proceed in the matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
of meting out punishment; and as they sat in
silence, pondering over the confession, it was Jed
himself who solved the problem.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m glad you didn’t come to the house
with the intention of burning it, Pud,” he exclaimed.
“You and I know I hadn’t occasion
for being fond of you, but I’d hate to think there
was any boy, or man either for that matter, in
Rivertown who was so down on me that he would
want to burn the roof over my head.
</p>
<p>
“Now, I’ve carried a bit of insurance on the
place and I’m not going to live very much longer,
so if——”
</p>
<p>
“Jed, I ain’t liked you no better than my boy,”
interrupted the butcher, “but you’ve been so decent,
and not asked me to punish Pud or send him
away where they’ll take care of him, that if it’s
agreeable to you I’ll give you two hundred and
fifty dollars. Pud, go get my check book.”
</p>
<p>
“No need to bother about that to-night,
Snooks. You can give me the money to-morrow,”
declared Jed. And with this understanding Mr.
Martin and the crippled veteran took their departure.
</p>
<p>
Once they were outside, the village patriarch
seized the hand of the crippled veteran and shook
it heartily.
</p>
<p>
“Jed, you certainly are a man!” he exclaimed,
feelingly. “But where will you go to live, now?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
</p>
<p>
Ere the old man could answer, Harry and Paul,
who had been waiting outside the house, joined
them just in time to hear Mr. Martin ask this
question.
</p>
<p>
“If you’d care to, I should like to have you
come around to our house!” exclaimed Harry.
“I know Aunt Mary would like it, and then as
you’re an old friend of dad’s he’d want me to
ask you.”
</p>
<p>
“That would be just the thing,” asserted Mr.
Martin, “and I don’t doubt but that you can
make arrangements to live at her house with
Mary as long as you care to stay in Rivertown.
I’ll go and explain things.”
</p>
<p>
Surprised at first, after the incidents of the
evening had been made clear to her, Mrs. Watson
readily agreed to board the veteran as long as
he cared to remain; and after bidding them all
a cordial good-night, Mr. Martin and Paul went
to their home.
</p>
<p>
Many were the glances that were cast at the
bully and Harry when they appeared at the high
school the following day, but no one had the
temerity to speak to them about the incident of
the fire, although there were many whispered
conversations held in which the sympathy was
entirely with the new student.
</p>
<p>
As Paul had said, the only lesson of importance
the freshman class were called upon to attend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
was the Latin, of which the crusty old Prof. Isaac
Plummer, often called “Grouch” by the students,
was instructor.
</p>
<p>
As the boys and girls filed into the classroom,
the professor, who was a little squat man, with a
scrubby beard, so thin that one of the girls had
said it was really an individual beard, glanced
at them over the tops of his spectacles.
</p>
<p>
“There’s no use asking any of you, I suppose,
whether you have your lesson or not,” he snapped,
in a high-pitched, jerky voice. “The fire last
night would have been a sufficient excuse, I suppose,
even if it wasn’t for the fact that you never
do have your lesson anyway.”
</p>
<p>
Then, his eyes resting on Harry, he exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing in here?”
</p>
<p>
“I came to recite, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Listen, the rest of you. Here’s a boy who
has come to recite. Do you, by any chance, happen
to be a member of the Rivertown High
School, or have you just dropped in like manna
sent from Heaven to show the rest of these young
idiots that it is possible for a child to know its
Latin lesson? What’s your name?”
</p>
<p>
“Harry Watson,” stammered the boy, his face
scarlet at the brusqueness of the Latin instructor’s
greeting.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you come from?”
</p>
<p>
“Lawrenceburgh, sir.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
</p>
<p>
“Do you like Latin?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Then that explains it. I don’t wonder you
left Lawrenceburgh. No man who cared for
Latin would ever live there, let alone learn it
in any of their schools. How far have you gone
in Caesar?”
</p>
<p>
“Through the first two books.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed! I didn’t suppose anyone ever got
beyond the grammar in Lawrenceburgh. Suppose
you start in at the beginning of the second book,
which is our lesson to-day, and read as far as
you can.”
</p>
<p>
During this tirade many were the nudges in
which the boys and girls indulged themselves; and
Elmer and Pud had reveled in it, gleefully, believing
that they were about to witness the discomfiture
of the boy for whom they had conceived
such a dislike.
</p>
<p>
But Harry was fond of Latin and was also well
grounded in his fundamentals. Opening his book
at the part indicated, he began to translate, and
Prof. Plummer allowed him to finish two sections
before he began to ask him questions on
construction. But though he tried his best to
confuse the boy, Harry did not get rattled, and
acquitted himself creditably.
</p>
<p>
“Watson, I want you to come up here,” the
instructor exclaimed, when he had finished.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
“Let me shake hands with you. I’m glad to know
there is one scholar in Rivertown High School
who has even the faintest conception of the Latin
fundamentals.”
</p>
<p>
Blushing even more furiously than he had
while he was being baited, Harry stood in his
place uncertain whether the professor meant what
he said or not, and hoping in his heart that he did
not.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, you hesitate, I see,” grinned Prof. Plummer,
sardonically. “After you know me better
you will know I never mean what I say. Never
to my knowledge have I willingly had one of
the pupils of Rivertown High School approach
any nearer than you are now. Kindly remember
that.”
</p>
<p>
And after calling upon one after another of the
members of the class only to have them answer
“Not prepared,” old Grouch dismissed the class
in disgust.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—PLEDGED TO THE PI ETAS</h2>
<p>
Although the majority of the scholars in the
Rivertown High School lived in Rivertown, there
were a goodly number who came from adjacent
villages, and for the benefit of these, as well as
to give a greater school life to those who lived
at home, the trustees of the high school had sanctioned
the use of several halls as society rooms.
</p>
<p>
Thus the girls had two for their exclusive use,
the Gamma Gammas and the Lambda Nus; and
the boys three, the Kappa Phis, the senior society,
the Psi Mus, to which only juniors were
eligible, and the Pi Etas, nicknamed the Pie
Eaters by the upper classmen, composed chiefly
of sophomores, although such of the freshmen
as were not too crude were admitted to membership.
</p>
<p>
For several days after Harry’s encounter with
the Latin professor, he was discussed by the
boys at the head of the Pi Etas, and, after deciding
that he was eligible, the members began to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
rush him, inviting him around to the club room,
to their homes, their skating and dancing parties.
</p>
<p>
Elmer and Socker, as well as Paul and Jerry,
belonged to the Greek letter society, and the proposal
to take Harry into the folds of the Pi
Eta met with a vigorous opposition from the
former pair. Sufficient were there of the sophs,
however, who believed that, with a little rubbing
off of the rough edges, Harry would be a desirable
member of their crowd, to out-vote them, and in
due course a committee was selected to pledge
him.
</p>
<p>
But when Harry was approached, he exhibited
no great enthusiasm. Fortunately, however, Paul
and Jerry were members of the committee and,
after the full body had sounded him, they remained
at his aunt’s house with him.
</p>
<p>
“What’s wrong? Don’t you like the crowd?”
asked Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“You bet I do! It isn’t that.” And then our
hero paused, blushing, finally continuing:
</p>
<p>
“I might as well tell you fellows, because it will
save a lot of unpleasantness for me. I can’t afford
to do the things the rest of you fellows can.”
</p>
<p>
At this frank announcement, Paul and Jerry
looked at one another in dismay, for neither of
them knew exactly how to answer, and moreover,
it was confirmation of their belief that Harry’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
refusal to go on the sleigh ride was because of
his lack of funds.
</p>
<p>
As the pause that ensued after the statement
became embarrassing, Jerry took the bit in his
teeth.
</p>
<p>
“There’s practically no expense, Harry. No
initiation fees, or anything like that. All we have
to do is to pay for the light and heat. The school
pays the rent, that is, they say they do, though
none of the rooms or halls of Rivertown societies
have cost a penny, for they’re given by people
who own the property. My assessment, so far,
this year has been seventy-five cents. You know
there are fifty Pi Etas and the expenses for the
rest of the year, with Spring coming before long,
will be still less, and we want you to be one of the
bunch,—honestly, we do. It means no end of fun
next year, the Psi Mu surely for junior and the
Kappa Phi for senior year.”
</p>
<p>
A lot of other things Jerry and Paul told our
hero, and by the time they had finished talking
to him, he had fully come to the conclusion that he
would get the money to pay his dues in some
manner, and he signified his delight at the prospect
of joining the society.
</p>
<p>
“Good boy!” chorused his chums. “Just stay
in your room to-night. As your superiors in the
Pi Eta we command you to.”
</p>
<p>
And hitting the boy such powerful whacks on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
his back that is seemed to him his teeth would fall
out, Paul and Jerry left him. Descending the
stairs, they bade Mrs. Watson a significantly courteous
“good night” and hurried back to the society
room to carry the tidings of Harry’s acceptance
to their waiting fellows.
</p>
<p>
With an understanding of what the call of all
the boys upon her nephew meant that would have
done credit to a father, Harry’s aunt went to her
desk, took out a sheet of paper, and wrote:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“My Dear Boy:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“I hope you find this of use, and it affords
me more pleasure to be able to give it to you than
it can you to receive it.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“Lovingly, Aunt Mary.</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“P. S.—If anything should ever happen that
you should get into a little scrape, I want you to
feel that you can come to me. Tell me all about
it instead of going to an outsider. I shall be able
to help you.”
</p>
<p>
And enclosing a five dollar bill, she put it into
an envelope and biding her time until Harry came
downstairs, slipped up to his room and placed it
on his study table where he would be sure to find
it.
</p>
<p>
Wonder as to what his instructions to remain
in the house meant filled Harry with an alternating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
succession of vague misgiving and delight, and
appreciating his mood, his aunt humored him during
supper, refraining from pressing him with any
awkward questions as to his unusual nervousness.
</p>
<p>
When he finished supper, Harry stayed around
downstairs till he heard the sound of voices out
in the street in front of the house. As they drew
nearer and nearer, it became evident that they
were chanting.
</p>
<p>
“Mercy! What can that be? It sounds like
a funeral dirge!” exclaimed Mrs. Watson, simulating
an ignorance of the familiar song by which
the Pi Etas announced their descent upon a
prospective victim to their initiation, though she
had heard it numberless times before, when the
members of the society in years gone by had
passed through the street in quest of their victims.
</p>
<p>
The blood mounting to his face, Harry listened
a moment, then ran up to his room, grabbed up
his Caesar, dropped into a chair and vainly strove
to concentrate his mind upon the text before him.
</p>
<p>
Once only in a life-time does the indescribable
thrill grip the heart of a boy who realizes that he
has been found fit by the most critical jury in the
world, his fellow students, to become a member
of one of their secret societies—and in the ecstasy
of his happiness Harry never noticed that his
book was upside down.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—A SERIOUS CHARGE</h2>
<p>
As the measured tread of the steps of the
students marching in military time rang out on the
porch, Harry could not restrain his feelings, and
jumped to his feet, pacing excitedly up and down
his room.
</p>
<p>
For moments that seemed eternal after the
sound of the tramping came, he listened for the
peremptory knock.
</p>
<p>
At last it came, and as it rang out, with significance
the boy could never forget, his heart almost
stopped beating—then he was dully aware that
his aunt had gone to the door and opened it. He
heard the sound of excited voices, then it seemed
as though there were a mighty crash against the
door of his room, in rushed several of the boys
whom he knew, seized him, tossed him to their
shoulders and started down the stairs, not a word
having been spoken. But as he gained the outside
door, the boys assembled in the yard broke into a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
chant of triumph, and with the new student still
borne aloft, they retraced their steps down the
street, the rhythm of their song growing in its
delirium until they reached their society room.
</p>
<p>
But once Harry was inside the sacred precincts,
guarded by the four plastered walls, he was no
longer the good fellow sought by his schoolmates,
but the victim of initiation—and before he had
performed all the stunts which were put up to him,
it was early in the morning. And when he made
his way to his aunt’s house, it was not the carefree
boy who had been borne forth on the
shoulders of his friends, but a youth, bedraggled,
and with a more proper appreciation of his utter
insignificance in the scheme of life.
</p>
<p>
Proud to think that her nephew had been picked
out for one of the members of the secret society,
Mrs. Watson sat up, with the purpose of welcoming
him when he returned home. But as hour
after hour went by without his appearing, after
the manner of a woman, she began to fear that
some harm had befallen him. Accordingly, when
at last she heard his halting footsteps on the
porch, she threw open the door, and greeted him
fondly.
</p>
<p>
But Harry was so used up that he failed to
appreciate the tenderness of the caress, and, realizing
the fact, his aunt sent him to bed with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
the injunction to sleep as late in the morning as he
pleased.
</p>
<p>
Sore, indeed, was Harry when he awoke the
next morning, but as he noted the glance cast at
him by the other fellows passing on the way to
school, glances in which there was a certain
amount of envy, he began to forget the ache and
pain, caused by the anything but gentle thumps he
had received during his initiation, and by the time
he had reached the schoolhouse, he was quite his
natural self.
</p>
<p>
But though the boy was in exuberant spirits, it
did not take him long to realize that a depression
had fallen upon his society mates, and he lost no
time in trying to learn the cause.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” he asked Paul and Jerry, as
they came toward him.
</p>
<p>
“It’s fierce, that’s what it is,” returned Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“But why don’t you tell me what it is?”
</p>
<p>
“Because nobody knows <em>exactly</em>,” asserted
Paul.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll know, though, just as soon as chapel’s
over,” announced Jerry, in a voice so doleful,
that the last vestige of Harry’s enthusiasm vanished.
</p>
<p>
Not far into the school grounds had Harry
and his companions proceeded, before the boy
had found that the gloom shared by his society
brothers was reflected in all whom he met, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
though he nodded to such of the boys and girls
as he knew, when there was any response at all,
it was merely perfunctory.
</p>
<p>
“Sort of a dismal morning to hand out to a
new Pi Eta, what?” exclaimed Misery.
</p>
<p>
But Harry had become too imbued with the
spirit of disaster to make any reply, and as he
took his seat in the chapel, he was as anxious-eyed
as any of the others.
</p>
<p>
The formal chapel service over, Mr. Larmore
closed the Bible with decided emphasis, and then,
taking off his glasses and wiping them nervously,
he leaned over the little reading table and gazed
at the hushed students before him.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry, very sorry, to tell you all that there
were depredations committed last night in the
physical laboratory belonging to the school.
</p>
<p>
“Several pieces of valuable experimental apparatus
were destroyed.
</p>
<p>
“I believe that you all have too much understanding
to make it necessary for me to dwell upon
the heinousness of such acts.
</p>
<p>
“The incident, bad as it is of itself, is particularly
unfortunate in view of the fact that
there was, as I understand, an initiation in one
of the Greek letter societies last night!”
</p>
<p>
The significance of the principal’s words were
so unmistakable that, as they were uttered, a gasp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
of shocked surprise ran through the benches of
the students.
</p>
<p>
Not one among them was there who did not
know that Harry had been the boy who was
initiated, and, as if drawn by an irresistible impulse,
they turned their gaze upon him.
</p>
<p>
Again clearing his throat, Mr. Larmore started
to speak, when a boy rose from the seats occupied
by the seniors.
</p>
<p>
“My name is Thomas Dawson. You know
me, Mr. Larmore. So do the other people of
Rivertown and the scholars of the high school.
</p>
<p>
“I had the honor to be elected a member of the
Pi Eta during my freshman year, and, in the
memory of what the society stands for in scholarship
and in manliness, in high ideals of school life,
I resent most emphatically the imputations in
your remarks cast upon the initiation into the Pi
Eta society last night!”
</p>
<p>
Never before had such a defiance to the principal
of the school been made, and as the boys
and girls who pursued their studies within its
brick walls heard it, they were seized with an
amazement even greater than at the words of the
principal.
</p>
<p>
But the cup of their surprise was not yet filled.
</p>
<p>
Pausing a moment after his statement, that the
dramatic effect of his utterance might be the
greater, Dawson exclaimed:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
“In the name of the members of the Pi Eta
society of Rivertown High School, I demand to
know the authority for your statement that it was
any of our members who caused the breaking of
the apparatus?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—THE BOYS APPOINT A COMMITTEE</h2>
<p>
Never before in the annals of Rivertown
High had such a scene been witnessed in the
chapel, and as the scholars realized that one of
their number was openly defying the man who,
for years had guided the destinies of those studying
under him, they were dumfounded.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Larmore, himself, evidently shared the
general astonishment for, as he heard Dawson’s
demand, his eyes flashed, he opened his mouth
as though to speak, and then, evidently thinking
better of it, closed it again.
</p>
<p>
The silence enveloping the chapel was so intense
that the fall of a pin would have sounded
loud.
</p>
<p>
Realizing that such a situation could not be
tolerated, the principal at last exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Dawson, I am surprised that you should
assume such an attitude in this matter.
</p>
<p>
“For obvious reasons, I cannot enter into an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
argument with you as to the source of my information.
I will say, however, that I consider my
authority reliable.
</p>
<p>
“It grieves me more than I can express to
think that any of my boys should so far forget
themselves in their sport as to do damage to the
school’s property.
</p>
<p>
“I shall go to my office directly after I have
dismissed chapel, and I shall expect those boys
who took part in the breaking of the apparatus
to come to me and confess.
</p>
<p>
“Chapel is dismissed.”
</p>
<p>
Instantly there was a hum of excited voices as
the boys and girls filed from the assembly room
where the chapel exercises were held.
</p>
<p>
Instead of going to their class rooms, however,
the members of the Pi Eta society filed out
of the schoolhouse and gathered about their
leader who had challenged the principal.
</p>
<p>
“Did any Pi Eta smash the apparatus?” asked
Dawson. “If he did, for the good of the society
he must go to Larmore and take his medicine. I
want to be sure of my facts before I take any
further action.”
</p>
<p>
But not a boy spoke up.
</p>
<p>
“I put you on your Pi Eta oath,” announced
Dawson.
</p>
<p>
But even this placing them on their most sacred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
honor had no additional effect upon the society
boys.
</p>
<p>
Several of the members of the other Greek
letter societies gathered about the Pi Etas—for
they realized that a crisis had arisen that affected
all the social organizations of the school—and
they wanted to plan how to meet it.
</p>
<p>
When, therefore, they learned that none of the
society members had been implicated in the
trouble, they cheered loudly.
</p>
<p>
“The thing to do now, is to find out who told
‘Princy’”—which was the nickname the boys applied
to the principal of the school—“that it was
the work of the Pi Etas,” said Dawson.
</p>
<p>
“It strikes me that the best thing to do is for
some of us to go in and have a talk with him,”
declared Longback, when none of the boys offered
any suggestion as to who the bearer of the information
might be.
</p>
<p>
“Why not let the Pi Etas settle it themselves?”
proposed another boy.
</p>
<p>
“Because it concerns the rest of us just as much
as it concerns them—as a matter of fact I believe
it concerns us more; because I’m sure that not
one of the Pi Etas had anything to do with it.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and if any of us should go into Princy’s
office, he and everybody else in the school, would
think we had come to confess,” declared Paul.
</p>
<p>
This argument proved a clincher for the plan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
of sending a delegation to call on Mr. Larmore
in his office, and without delay the boys expressed
their preferences, the committee finally being composed
of Dawson, Longback, Jerry, Harry and
Misery.
</p>
<p>
The new member of the society objected to
serving on the ground that it wouldn’t look well
for a boy who had just had the honor of coming
into the Pi Eta to take such a prominent part in
its affairs so soon.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you <em>must</em> come with us,” returned Dawson,
“and I’ll tell you why. There’s no use in
mincing matters. Princy and all the other profs
think that as part of your initiation, the rest of
us either made you break the apparatus, or that
you did so in a spirit of bravado.”
</p>
<p>
The case having been put to him thus plainly,
Harry offered no further objection to serving on
the committee, and without more ado the boys
who had been chosen as delegates mounted the
steps preparatory to going to the office of the
principal.
</p>
<p>
“What is it? School for the rest of us?”
called another boy, looking about at his companions.
</p>
<p>
“No, let’s cut?” cried three or four, while one
of them continued:
</p>
<p>
“It will show Princy and the other Profs that
we don’t like the deal he’s handing to us.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
</p>
<p>
Readily all the members of the Greek letter
societies in the school agreed to the plan, and
without even so much as going into the school
house for their books, they hied themselves to
their respective society rooms.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—MR. LARMORE ISSUES AN ULTIMATUM</h2>
<p>
The excitement among the rest of the scholars
as to what the members of the accused society
would do was intense, especially among the Greek
letter girls, and little, indeed, was the attention
they paid either to their books or recitations,
their eyes being upon the gathering of boys.
</p>
<p>
In ignorance of what had been decided upon,
when some of them beheld the five who had been
chosen to wait upon Mr. Larmore, they instantly
concluded that they must be the boys who had
taken part in the smashing of the instruments, and
quickly they passed the word along to the other
students who were unable to look out of the window.
</p>
<p>
As some of the boys who had advised against
sending the delegation had argued, when the
knock sounded on the door of the principal’s office
and the order to enter had been given, Mr.
Larmore believed that the five students who filed
in, had come to confess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, assuming a stern but injured manner,
he rose and bowed to each of them.
</p>
<p>
“There is no need for me to say that I am
shocked when I see who of my students took part
in the mischief, but I am glad that you are men
enough to come to me and tell——”
</p>
<p>
“Pardon me, Mr. Larmore, but you are mistaken,”
interrupted Dawson. “We have not
come to confess anything.”
</p>
<p>
“Eh? What?” exclaimed the principal, looking
over his glasses at the speaker.
</p>
<p>
“I said that we have not come to confess,” repeated
Dawson.
</p>
<p>
“Then to what do I owe the honor of this
call?” Mr. Larmore asked, dropping back into
his chair and assuming his most sarcastic tone and
manner.
</p>
<p>
“In the first place, we want to tell you that no
member of the Pi Eta society had a hand in the
doings in the physical laboratory; and in the
second, we wish to know who it was that charged
us with the work.”
</p>
<p>
As he heard the statement, the principal’s face
grew even more stern, and for several minutes he
thrummed his desk without making any reply.
</p>
<p>
He had not asked the boys to sit down, and
as they stood in front of him, they began to get
nervous, shifting uneasily in an embarrassed sort
of way from one foot to another as though unable to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
bear his gaze—and realizing how uncomfortable
he was making the boys, Mr. Larmore
kept silent longer than he otherwise would have.
</p>
<p>
Resenting such treatment, Dawson fidgeted with
his collar, and then exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Will you——”
</p>
<p>
“Just a moment, please,” interrupted the principal,
raising his hand to stop the boy. “I should
like to know on what grounds you make your
assertion that none of the Pi Etas took part in
the outrage.”
</p>
<p>
“Because they have told me so, sir,” replied
Dawson.
</p>
<p>
“Of course! How stupid of me. I should
have known that did the great Tom Dawson ask
who broke the apparatus, the guilty boy would
have run right up to him. I made a mistake in
not asking you to——”
</p>
<p>
During this ironical remark, the senior who
had taken upon himself to defend the members of
the under class society, grew very red.
</p>
<p>
“That’s not fair, Mr. Larmore!” he exclaimed,
interrupting the principal.
</p>
<p>
“Very well. Why should you expect the boys
to admit their guilt to you?”
</p>
<p>
“Because I asked them under Pi Eta oath.”
</p>
<p>
This reply was sufficiently illuminative to cause
the principal to cast a keen glance at the spokesman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
“Do you really mean to tell me any member
of that society would confess their guilt to you
if you put them on their oath?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“And may I ask what you would have done had
any of them made such a confession?”
</p>
<p>
“Sent them to you, sir.”
</p>
<p>
Again did the principal look over the top of his
glasses, and he realized as he never had before,
what a power the Greek letter societies could be in
the discipline of the school.
</p>
<p>
“But if no members of your club committed
the outrage, who did?” asked Mr. Larmore
finally, evidently voicing the thought that was in
his mind.
</p>
<p>
“That, sir, we cannot tell you at the moment—but
we will be able to later.”
</p>
<p>
“How, pray?”
</p>
<p>
“Because we shall make it a point to find out,
sir. And as a first step toward that end we should
be obliged if you would tell us who gave you the
information.”
</p>
<p>
“I will do that—presently. First, however, I
should like to ask you what punishment you think
should be meted out to the boys who are guilty?”
</p>
<p>
“I fancy they won’t be ready for punishment
for some time after we find out who they are,”
exclaimed Longback.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
Smiling at this answer to his question, Mr.
Larmore exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“I am obliged to you boys for coming to see
me. I’m sorry to say, however, that I cannot
accept your statements as to the innocence of the
members of the Pi Eta society in regard to smashing
the apparatus in the physical laboratory.
</p>
<p>
“My authority—who is no other than Tony,
the janitor,—is, I believe, altogether too reliable.
</p>
<p>
“For that reason, I have decided that until I
can learn who the perpetrators of the act are, to
punish them individually, I shall assess the Pi
Eta society the amount of the damages, which
comes to seventy dollars, and until payment is
made, I shall insist that the society’s room be
closed.
</p>
<p>
“I shall be obliged if you will act as collector
for me, Dawson. You can also announce my
decision to all the society members, though I shall
do it in school just before the noon recess.
</p>
<p>
“And now, young gentlemen, I bid you good
morning.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—STUMBLING ACROSS A CLUE</h2>
<p>
Mingled, indeed, were the feelings with which
the boys heard this ultimatum from Mr. Larmore.
</p>
<p>
After he had dropped his sarcasm, they believed
that he would at least be fair with them,
and accordingly, when they heard his terms, they
could scarcely believe their ears.
</p>
<p>
But they managed to control their feelings and,
bowing curtly, turned on their heels and strode
from the office.
</p>
<p>
Once out in the hallway they gave vent to their
indignation.
</p>
<p>
“My word! Princy must have had something
awful mean for breakfast to have accumulated
such a grouch!” exclaimed Misery.
</p>
<p>
“But we can’t blame him so much,” returned
Longback. “What sticks in my craw is that old
Tony Farelli, who was janitor at Rivertown High
when most of our fathers and mothers were students,
should have laid the trouble to the Pi
Etas.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
</p>
<p>
“He must have some good reason for thinking
it was some of us,” returned Dawson, “because
Tony has always been square.”
</p>
<p>
“Seventy dollars is going some,” declared
Jerry. “It looks to me as if the Pi Eta chapter
room will be closed for some time to come.”
</p>
<p>
“Shall you pay it? I suppose you’ll assess the
members equally?” asked Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Pay it! Well, I should say not!” retorted
Dawson, angrily. “Princy can nail up the door
of the chapter room first!”
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t go to making any threats, Tom,”
interposed Longback. “The thing to do is to
have a meeting of the Kappa Phis and Psi Mus
to decide what shall be done.”
</p>
<p>
“How about us?” demanded Jerry. “Being
the victims, it seems to me we should have a little
say in the matter.”
</p>
<p>
“There you go again,” retorted Dawson.
“You freshmen never can seem to understand
that it is part of your training to do as your
betters tell you. Inasmuch as just about all the
Kappa Phis are old Pi Eta men, you can be very
sure that nothing will be decided upon that will
lower the dignity of any Pie Eater.”
</p>
<p>
While they were talking, the boys were standing
upon the porch of the school building.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the principal had started on
his rounds of the various rooms, immediately upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
departure of the student committee, and it
was only a short time before he had learned that
all the Greek letter men had cut their classes.
</p>
<p>
Angered at such action, Mr. Larmore was
stalking back to his office, when he chanced to espy
the committee members through the glass in the
door.
</p>
<p>
Hastening his steps, he pushed open the inner
door, yanked the knob of the outside one so that
the door came open with a jerk, and faced the
boys.
</p>
<p>
“Why aren’t the Greek letter students at their
classes, and what are you doing out here?” he
demanded.
</p>
<p>
“I can only speak for myself, sir,” returned
Dawson. “I am out here because I’m not going
to school to-day.”
</p>
<p>
Only the tone in which he spoke saved the boy’s
speech from being grossly disrespectful, but the
principal had sufficient understanding of scholars
to know that it would not be well for him to press
the matter farther, and without another word, he
closed the door and returned to his office.
</p>
<p>
“Wow, but Princy’s mad!” ejaculated Jerry.
“Let’s get hold of the other fellows and decide
on our plan of action just as soon as we can.”
</p>
<p>
This suggestion met with the approval of the
other members of the committee, and forthwith
they hied themselves down the hill.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
As they reached the foot, they met a crowd of
boys hurrying toward them.
</p>
<p>
“Princy’s closed the Pi Eta room,” cried several
of them, as they gathered about the members
of their committee.
</p>
<p>
“We know it,” returned Dawson. “And
what’s more it will stay closed until the Pi Etas
pay seventy dollars, which Mr. Larmore says is
the amount of the damage done in the physical
laboratory—and that, I opine, will be some time
in the far distant future.”
</p>
<p>
At first the other boys refused to believe this
announcement, but they were quickly assured of
its authoritativeness, and when its full significance
dawned upon them they stared at one another
blankly.
</p>
<p>
“I can also tell you that Princy’s very sore
because the Greek letter men have cut their
classes.”
</p>
<p>
“My word, but the prospect looks cheerful,
doesn’t it?” commented Socker. “Where will
the Pi Eta bunch meet, now?”
</p>
<p>
“The graveyard seems the most appropriate
place,” asserted Misery.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to do without your chapter
room,” laughed Dawson. “In the meantime, the
Kappa Phis and the Psi Mus are going to have
a meeting to decide what you shall do.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s awfully sweet of you,” mocked one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
the freshmen. “I do hope you won’t decide on
anything that it won’t be perfectly ladylike to
do,” and turning to his companions he exclaimed:
“Come on, fellows, let’s go down to the river and
have a hockey game.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll do nothing of the sort,” countermanded
Dawson, as a dozen or so of the boys started off
to get their skates. “It’s up to you boys to find
Tony, while the rest of us are holding our consultation.”
</p>
<p>
“But what’s old Tony got to do with it?”
chorused several of the group.
</p>
<p>
“Everything, seeing that it is he who told
Princy the Pi Etas were in the laboratory,” returned
Longback, dryly.
</p>
<p>
“But there isn’t one of us Tony wouldn’t
recognize—except, of course, Watson.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it, exactly,” asserted Dawson.
</p>
<p>
“Can Watson prove an alibi?” demanded a
voice from the outside of the crowd which had
been constantly increasing, as the word had passed
around that the delegates had concluded their
interview with the principal of the Rivertown
High School.
</p>
<p>
“Who said that?” demanded Jerry, indignantly.
</p>
<p>
No one, however, made any response.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll wager the fellow who said that thing is
the one who broke the apparatus,” declared Paul.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
</p>
<p>
“Of course, I——” began Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Keep quiet! Shut up! Don’t answer him!
Forget it!” shouted several of the boys, effectually
drowning Harry’s words.
</p>
<p>
“You mustn’t forget you’re a Pi Eta, and that
a Pi Eta is never doubted,” said Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“Hear! Hear!” mocked several of the upper
classmen.
</p>
<p>
“Seriously, though, you mustn’t waste any more
time,” interposed Longback. “You noble spirited
Pi Etas go find Tony, and we’ll have our confab;
then you may meet us in the hall in front of the
Psi Mu chapter room.”
</p>
<p>
The freshmen, however, did not wait to hear
the last of the taunt, and breaking up into bands
of two or three, they started out with the purpose
of locating the janitor.
</p>
<p>
“Why not look for him at the school,” suggested
Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Because, this is his day to go to Lumberport,”
returned Jerry. “He always goes over there
every Thursday to draw money for school expenses.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe he hasn’t gone yet. Let’s go round
to his house,” suggested Paul.
</p>
<p>
Quickly, the boys who were natives of Rivertown
set out to guide their new chum to the house
where the janitor lived; but when they arrived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
they were disappointed to know that he had been
gone some two hours.
</p>
<p>
“Are you the young gentlemen he was expecting
to bring him money?” asked Mrs. Farelli.
</p>
<p>
“Money for what?” asked Paul, surprised.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, sir. He just said some young
men were to bring him some money and I thought
it might be you, so I was going to tell you he said
to take it over to Lumberport and leave it at
Rector’s cigar store for him, as he won’t be back
for a couple of days.”
</p>
<p>
“Then he hasn’t gone on school business, to-day?”
exclaimed Jerry, with a rising inflection
in his voice.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—THE TRIP TO LUMBERPORT</h2>
<p>
After thanking the janitor’s wife for her information,
the boys left the house.
</p>
<p>
“Funny Tony should be going to stay away a
couple of days,” remarked Paul, as he walked
along.
</p>
<p>
Both his companions agreed with him, but as
Harry had lived in Rivertown so short a time, he
was little acquainted with the habits of Farelli,
and so he could offer no intelligent comment.
</p>
<p>
“It seems to me we ought to get over to Lumberport
as quickly as we can,” announced Jerry.
“If we can locate Tony and pull the story out of
him before anyone else gets to him, it will be
some feather in our caps.”
</p>
<p>
“It seems to me we ought to tell Dawson, and
some of the other boys,” declared Harry. “If
there really is any crooked work they will be more
likely to make the janitor tell about it than we
would, I should think, considering the fact that
they have been at the school four years.”
</p>
<p>
To this suggestion, our hero’s chums agreed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
and quickly they betook themselves to the hall in
which the room of the Psi Mus was located.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got a nerve to rap at our door. Didn’t
we tell you to wait and meet us in the hall?” demanded
the boy who answered the summons.
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right. We’ve found out something
you people ought to know, so you needn’t
close the door in our faces,” retorted Jerry.
</p>
<p>
The statement that they had important information
to impart had been heard by the leaders
of the two societies who were holding the consultation,
and quickly they called to them to enter.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what is it that’s so important?” demanded
Dawson.
</p>
<p>
“We went down to see if Tony was at home,”
began Paul, when he was interrupted by one of
the others exclaiming:
</p>
<p>
“Of course he wasn’t. This is his day to go
to Lumberport on school business for Princy.”
</p>
<p>
“I know that,” retorted Paul, “but we thought
perhaps he might not have started yet. When we
got there, Mrs. Farelli asked us if we’d come to
pay Tony some money, for if we had, he wanted
us to leave it at Rector’s, in Lumberport, because
Tony won’t be home for a couple of days.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s just Tony’s way of trying to collect
his debts quickly,” commented one of the boys.
</p>
<p>
“Then why shouldn’t he have told his wife to
take it,” asked Harry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p>
“And that’s what he would do,” interposed
Dawson. “I say it won’t do any harm for some
of us to go over to Rector’s and see what’s up.
In the meantime, you three boys keep your mouths
closed about what Mrs. Farelli told you.”
</p>
<p>
To their disappointment, none of the freshmen
were invited to become members of the party that
went to Lumberport, but they trailed along, nevertheless;
and when they trooped into the tobacco
store which the janitor had appointed as a rendezvous,
they were surprised to see Elmer Craven
and Pud Snooks talking with Tony.
</p>
<p>
Their amazement, however, was nothing compared
to that of the two students of Rivertown
High when they discovered the presence of their
schoolmates.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t know you boys would dare come into
a cigar store,” growled Elmer, scowling.
</p>
<p>
“So that’s why you selected it for your meeting
place with Tony?” retorted Dawson, and
then, ignoring the presence of the rich boy, the
leader of the Kappa Phis turned to the janitor.
</p>
<p>
“Tony, I want you tell me which of the Pi
Etas it was who broke the stuff last night?”
</p>
<p>
“It was this young man, here,” returned the
Italian, nodding toward Harry.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” demanded the accused
boy, his face blanching. “I wasn’t anywhere
near the schoolhouse last night. Just as soon as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
the fun was over at the chapter room, I went
home—and to bed.”
</p>
<p>
“I can vouch for the going home part of it,”
declared Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“And so can I,” added Paul.
</p>
<p>
“And my aunt can vouch for my being in the
house,” continued Harry.
</p>
<p>
“You see, Tony, you must have made a mistake,
don’t you?” pursued Dawson.
</p>
<p>
The charge that he had been wrong in the
identification of the marauder angered the Italian
and he did not hesitate to let the fact be known.
</p>
<p>
Dawson and Harry’s chums, however, refused
to accept the janitor’s statement, and began to
ply him with a series of cross questions which
finally extracted the statement from him that
there really was a possibility he had made an
error because he was fully thirty feet away from
the person he had seen in the building, and the
only light he had was a lantern.
</p>
<p>
As these facts were brought out, the boys who
formed the investigating committee exchanged
significant glances.
</p>
<p>
But their surprise was to be still further increased.
</p>
<p>
With an unexpectedness that made them gasp,
Dawson exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“I want you to tell me, Tony, if it isn’t in connection
with this identification business that Pud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
and Elmer came over here to pay you some
money?”
</p>
<p>
Too amazed to speak, the janitor and the boys
with whom he had been talking when the others
entered the tobacco shop, glanced at one another.
</p>
<p>
And their action was accepted by the other
boys as a tacit admission that the amazing charge
made by Dawson was true.
</p>
<p>
“Well, why don’t you tell me?” repeated the
leader of the Kappa Phis who had been acting as
spokesman.
</p>
<p>
“Because it is a matter that does not concern
you,” retorted the janitor.
</p>
<p>
“But you can’t deny it was about this laboratory
business, now, Tony, can you?” pursued his
interrogator.
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t been given any money by those
boys,” protested the janitor.
</p>
<p>
“But your wife said you were expecting some
from them,” declared Dawson, stretching the
truth, that he might make his point more effective.
</p>
<p>
“They haven’t given me a cent,” whined the
Italian. “They backed out!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—HARRY ARRANGES FOR A SETTLEMENT</h2>
<p>
Aware that they had been discovered in their
underhand work, Pud and Elmer worked their
way toward the door while Dawson was quizzing
the janitor, and when they heard his statement
that they had gone back on their bargain, they
made a bolt to get outside. But Jerry blocked
them.
</p>
<p>
“No, you’ll have to stay here until this matter
is settled once and for all,” he exclaimed, his
face growing white and his hands clenching.
</p>
<p>
Realizing that resistance was futile, the two
boys slunk back from the door and awaited the
further action of Dawson and his companions.
</p>
<p>
“Why not let them go?” suggested Harry.
“Mr. Farelli’s words and their actions have vindicated
the Pi Etas, and it seems to me very poor
policy to bring any scandal to Rivertown High.”
</p>
<p>
“But you forget that Princy has assessed a fine
of seventy dollars on the Pi Etas,” protested
Dawson. “While I’m perfectly willing to let the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
matter drop, I see no reason why the boys who
are members should be compelled to pay out
money for something for which they were not
responsible in any way.”
</p>
<p>
Although Harry’s suggestion had met with
murmurs of approval from the other boys when
it had been made, the senior’s statement had
brought back to their minds the cost of such procedure,
and they were equally enthusiastic for the
latter plan.
</p>
<p>
The thought that he could get himself out of a
situation which had become decidedly embarrassing,
since his schoolmates had discovered him in
conference with the janitor and the bully of Rivertown
High made Elmer come forward.
</p>
<p>
“Suppose I agree to pay the seventy dollars
and let the matter rest? Is that agreeable to you
fellows?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“We ought to know how the trick was
planned,” declared Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“Especially as it is Harry against whom the
insinuation is the most serious,” added Paul.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, never mind about me,” exclaimed our
hero. “The only thing to be considered is what’s
best for the Pi Etas and for Rivertown High.”
</p>
<p>
This stand of the new student appealed to the
rest of the boys, and at a sign from Dawson, they
withdrew to a corner of the cigar store for a
conference, leaving Harry, the janitor, Snooks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
and Elmer leaning against the glass showcase.
</p>
<p>
The entire proceeding had been distasteful to
the janitor, who had filled his position for so
many years and, believing that it would be best
for him to propitiate the boy for whom the other
students had taken up the cudgels, he riveted his
eyes upon the new member of the Pi Etas.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know, I think I was wrong, sir, when
I told Mr. Larmore that you were the boy I had
seen in the building.”
</p>
<p>
“You most certainly were!” returned Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, in a time of excitement, any man is
apt to be mistaken,” interposed Elmer, lightly,
“and so long as no harm has been done, if I am
willing to pay the expense, I don’t see why the
matter should go any farther.”
</p>
<p>
At this statement, Harry looked at the rich boy.
</p>
<p>
“So you don’t think it’s any harm to have such
a charge made against you when you are practically
unknown to the school authorities, and to the
people of the town in which the school is located?”
he asked.
</p>
<p>
At the question, Elmer flushed and before he
could think of a reply that was adequate, Dawson
and the boys with whom he had been talking,
moved over towards them.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve decided that if Watson is willing to
overlook the affront that has been put upon him,
for the good of the Pi Etas and Rivertown High,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
we will allow you to pay the seventy dollars,
Craven, and let the matter drop.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well, I will go to Mr. Larmore in the
morning,” announced Elmer, his relief at the solution
of the difficulty evidenced by the look which
settled on his face.
</p>
<p>
“No, that won’t do,” returned Dawson. “Mr.
Larmore appointed me as collector of the assessment,
and if the matter is to be arranged as you
suggested, you must give the money to me. I will
pay him. In that way, no one but ourselves need
know of the real facts.”
</p>
<p>
“But I shall need time in which to raise the
money,” protested Elmer.
</p>
<p>
“How long?” asked the boy who had been
acting as spokesman.
</p>
<p>
“A month, I should say.”
</p>
<p>
“And we’re to stand for the Pi Eta society
room being closed for that length of time just to
accommodate you,” demanded Jerry, stepping
toward Elmer.
</p>
<p>
As though fearing an assault from his schoolmate,
the rich boy drew back.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I might be able to get the money in
two weeks,” he announced.
</p>
<p>
“That won’t do, either,” said Dawson. “Knowing
you as I do, it is my opinion that you have
the money right in your pocket this minute.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
</p>
<p>
“But think of the sum, seventy dollars,” protested
Elmer.
</p>
<p>
“Which is nothing to you, if the stories that
come from Lumberport and Springtown are true,”
returned the senior, “and besides, I can tell from
the way Snooks is acting that he has some money
in his pocket.
</p>
<p>
“Now you two boys might just look the matter
squarely in the face. You have deeply wronged
Harry Watson—for reasons best known to yourselves.
Watson is a member of the Pi Eta and
a scholar in Rivertown High and is willing to
overlook your actions, provided you clear the society
from all odium.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t mind telling you frankly that it was
only because I insisted upon it that the rest of the
boys who came over with me consented to such an
arrangement.
</p>
<p>
“But unless you pay the money at once and to
me, I shall withdraw my objections to the true
state of affairs being told to Mr. Larmore—and
you all know what the result of such action would
be.”
</p>
<p>
The tones in which the senior spoke were bitter
and, fully as much as the words, they made Craven
understand that he could not count upon the
sympathy or support of the other Greek letter
men.
</p>
<p>
And even Snooks, who had never been able to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
gratify his dearest ambition of becoming a Pi Eta,
felt their sting.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got fifteen dollars,” the bully announced.
“If you have the rest let’s pay it, Elmer.”
</p>
<p>
This statement that the butcher’s son had any
money in his pocket was a distinct surprise not
alone to Elmer but to the other boys, and deeming
that it would make the burden upon him just so
much the lighter, Craven put his hand in his
pocket.
</p>
<p>
“Very well. I have fifty dollars. With Pud’s
fifteen that will make sixty-five. If the rest of
you will raise the remaining five dollars among
yourselves, I will pay it in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
In his talk, Dawson had been more or less bluffing,
for he had not thought that even as rich as
Elmer’s father was, he allowed him any such
amount of money; and when he had heard the boy
announce that he had fifty dollars in his pocket,
he could scarcely restrain the exclamation of surprise
that rose to his lips. But he managed to
dissemble his feelings.
</p>
<p>
“All right. You place your money on the
showcase, Elmer, and you put yours down, Pud.”
</p>
<p>
Quickly, the two boys obeyed and, after verifying
the count, Dawson turned to the others.
</p>
<p>
“It’s up to us to make up the other five dollars.
Come on, shell out?” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“I have fifty cents,” and producing the coin, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
laid it down on the showcase beside the other
money.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the boys, however, not being accustomed
to carrying money about with them, fidgeted
nervously, then put their hands in their pockets,
and the sum total they produced did not
amount to over fifty cents more.
</p>
<p>
Enjoying their embarrassment, Elmer’s face
suddenly lighted.
</p>
<p>
“You fellows have driven hard terms with me,
and if you can’t make up the other five dollars,
then I withdraw my offer to stand the brunt of the
cost.”
</p>
<p>
In dismay, Dawson and his friends looked at
one another, but just as they were on the point of
admitting they could not carry out their agreement,
Harry took out an envelope from his pocket.
</p>
<p>
“I have five dollars,” he announced. “And
for the sake of the Pi Etas and Rivertown, I
should be glad to put it into the fund.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—UPHOLDING THE HONOR OF RIVERTOWN</h2>
<p>
Even Elmer and Snooks could not but appreciate
the magnanimity of this offer, aware as they
were of the straightened circumstances of the new
student.
</p>
<p>
“Good boy!” exclaimed the others. “We’ll
make it up to you just as soon as we get back to
Rivertown.”
</p>
<p>
Such strong dislike, however, had he conceived
for Harry, that Elmer could not bear the thought
of being under obligations to him to the slightest
extent, and with an angry movement he thrust his
hand in his pocket, pulling out a five dollar bill.
</p>
<p>
“Here! Take this,” he snarled at Dawson.
“I was saving it out to get home on, but it doesn’t
amount to anything to me, and I suppose that five
dollars Watson has is his spending money for the
year.”
</p>
<p>
The wanton brutality of the remark brought an
angry flush to Harry’s face, and clenching his
hands, he started toward the rich youth. But with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
no desire to have any trouble in the town across
the river, Dawson, Paul and Jerry quickly placed
themselves between the two boys, while the senior
took the extra money from Elmer and wrapped it
with that which he had, giving back to Harry the
bill which our hero’s aunt had presented to him.
</p>
<p>
At first, the new member of the Pi Eta society
was disposed to resent the act.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be foolish,” exclaimed Dawson. “Craven
and Snooks were the ones who smashed the
apparatus—I don’t know exactly how—but you
never would find them willing to pay a cent unless
they were guilty; and it is perfectly right that Craven
should pay all the money he can rake or
scrape together.”
</p>
<p>
At this stinging comment, Elmer opened his
mouth as though he intended making a retort;
but second thought showed him the futility of so
doing, and buttoning up his coat, he nodded towards
Snooks and left the store with the bully.
</p>
<p>
As soon as they were gone, the senior turned
upon the janitor.
</p>
<p>
“Tony, I never thought to find you in such a
mess as this.”
</p>
<p>
With tears in his eyes, the Italian spoke to the
boys:
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t want to, but my little girl, she is sick,
and I need some money; and so when Elmer and
Pud come to me and tell me they would give me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
fifty dollars if I will say Watson broke the stuff,
I talked it over with my woman, and she say take
it.”
</p>
<p>
This confession of the janitor’s, substantiating
the idea which the boys had formed of the incident,
together with the thought that his temptation
had come from the fact that his child was ill,
caused them to forego any further cross-questioning
of the janitor, and they took their departure
from the cigar store.
</p>
<p>
The return to Rivertown was much in the nature
of an ovation for Harry, for not long was it
after the committee appointed by the Greek letter
societies started out than word of their purpose
spread among the scholars.
</p>
<p>
With the letting out of school for the noon recess,
the girls who were members of the Gamma
Gammas and the Lambda Nus learned of the action
of the boys, and forthwith they decided to cut
classes for the rest of the day.
</p>
<p>
Particularly caustic in their comments upon the
action of the principal were Viola and Nettie; but
as the older girls counseled a waiting policy, the
two freshmen were prevented from doing anything
that would further complicate the unfortunate
case.
</p>
<p>
The action of the girls depleted the ranks of
the school still further. It was with difficulty the
instructors could maintain any sort of discipline
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
during the afternoon, and when the last session
was over for the day, the boys and girls hastened
down to the river, put on their skates and started
across to the town of Lumberport.
</p>
<p>
Before they had reached the other side of the
river, however, they met Dawson and the other
boys returning, and as they saw the happy expression
on their faces, their curiosity was
aroused to a high pitch.
</p>
<p>
But though they plied them with questions, they
were unable to extract any more satisfactory explanation
from them than that the matter had been
settled.
</p>
<p>
Loud were the protests at this terse announcement
and the various friends of the boys who had
gone across the river had drawn them aside and
were striving their utmost to learn the real facts,
when there was a loud shout from up the river.
</p>
<p>
Turning, the members of the Rivertown High
beheld the red and white banners which were the
colors of the high school at Springtown, and almost
simultaneously with the recognition of the
identity of the approaching crowd, they heard the
artillery like rattle of the school cheer.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with Springtown? What’s
up now?” exclaimed several of the boys.
</p>
<p>
“Give them the Rivertown cheer. All together
now, everybody! Act as though you were alive,”
shouted Dawson, and swinging his arms in lieu of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
a baton he led the cheer, whose volume rolled up
the river, breaking with defiance in the ears of
the down-coming horde of skaters.
</p>
<p>
“The quickest way to find out what’s doing is to
go up to meet them,” announced Jerry.
</p>
<p>
And without more ado, he and a few of the
other boys started off up the river.
</p>
<p>
Massed together as though they were defenders
of a town repelling a hostile attack, the other boys
and girls assumed a compact mass, watching the
members of their own school as they sped toward
the phalanx of the neighboring town.
</p>
<p>
No sooner had they noted the movement of the
leaders among the members of Rivertown High,
than the Springtownians checked their advance,
and after a few moment’s hesitation, they sent part
of their number to meet the delegation from Rivertown.
</p>
<p>
The parley between the two groups was short;
then the Rivertown members turned on their
skates and started back to their schoolmates at
top speed.
</p>
<p>
“Springtown’s come down for a race,” one of
the boys announced. “Shall we give it to them?”
</p>
<p>
For years the schools in the neighboring towns
were rivals in all branches of athletics, and though
the percentage of victories had been with the
scholars at the head of the river, there never was
a time when they could propose any game that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
boys and girls of Rivertown were not eager to
take up the challenge.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly when the member of the high
school on the bluff asked if his mates wished to
accept the challenge of the Springtownians there
was a mighty shout of “Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“But who’ll represent us?” exclaimed three or
four of the seniors.
</p>
<p>
“Craven isn’t in the bunch, Longback has a
grouch, and Snooks is missing too,” exclaimed
Misery. “Why not call the boys’ race off, and
let Annabel represent Rivertown?”
</p>
<p>
“Now don’t get funny,” admonished Dawson.
“There are plenty of us here who can uphold old
Rivertown.”
</p>
<p>
“Who?” demanded several voices.
</p>
<p>
“Jerry and Paul—and Watson,” added another
voice.
</p>
<p>
“How about it. You fellows want to make a
try?”
</p>
<p>
“Who are we going up against?”
</p>
<p>
“The very best men in Springtown.”
</p>
<p>
“Do they race fair?” asked Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t you get anyone else to go against them
in my place?”
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t seem so. You heard what Misery
said.”
</p>
<p>
This parley was interrupted by the arrival of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
the advance guard of the scholars who had come
down to challenge their rivals at Rivertown.
</p>
<p>
“Are you going to let us win by default?”
asked one of the boys from Springtown.
</p>
<p>
“Not so you’d notice it. When it comes to
count the winners, Springtown won’t have a look
in!” returned Dawson.
</p>
<p>
His words brought a cheer of encouragement
from his schoolmates.
</p>
<p>
“Then let’s get busy and start the races right
away,” announced the spokesman for the Springtownians.
</p>
<p>
“All right. Bring the men out. We have only
three. How long is the race going to be?”
</p>
<p>
In response to this question various were the
exclamations of opinion; some clamored for two
miles, others asserting that one was enough. When
they could come to no definite conclusion, several
of the leaders from each of the schools got together
to try to settle the distance.
</p>
<p>
Their attempt, however, was as unsuccessful as
had been those of the scholars en masse; and finally
Socker Gales exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Let’s toss a coin!”
</p>
<p>
The suggestion met with instant approval from
both of the opposing forces.
</p>
<p>
Quickly Dawson drew a coin from his pocket,
balancing it on his thumb and forefinger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll toss. Springtown, you call!” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
High in the air he spun the coin, and as it
whirled over and over, the leader of the Springtownians,
shouted: “Tails!”
</p>
<p>
With a sharp click the bit of money struck the
ice, and then as though driven by perverseness, it
rolled some twenty feet, finally striking a depression,
into which it fell.
</p>
<p>
The instant the coin had struck the ice and
started on it’s runaway career, the boys who had
been watching the tossing, set after it; but fleet as
they were, it managed to elude them and had settled
in the ice crevice before they had overtaken
it.
</p>
<p>
“Which is it?” called the others, as two of the
Rivertown boys reached the spot.
</p>
<p>
“Heads,” they replied.
</p>
<p>
“That means you lose, Springtown!” chorused
the rest of the Rivertown scholars.
</p>
<p>
But the challengers from up the river refused
to accept the fall of the coin as an omen.
</p>
<p>
“Which distance are you going to take?” demanded
the leader of the visitors.
</p>
<p>
“Wait until I talk with the boys who are going
to race,” announced Dawson.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll make it two miles!” he finally exclaimed,
after a brief consultation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
</p>
<p>
This announcement met with varied exclamations
from the Rivertown students.
</p>
<p>
“Paul and Jerry never can stand that distance
in the world,” shouted several of their mates.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind, that’s Watson’s pet race, and all
we want to do is win it,” declared Misery. “This
isn’t a meet where we have to have points to win.”
</p>
<p>
But despite his confident announcement, there
were many of the scholars who scoffed at the
thought that the boy who had so lately come to
Rivertown would be able to defeat the man who
had twice won the race for Springtown.
</p>
<p>
Realizing what was in their minds, several of
the seniors skated about among the Rivertown students.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t sulk!” they exclaimed. “Show some
life! We chose the two miles, and it’s up to you
people to give some support to the boys who are
going to race! Don’t act as though you thought
we were beaten already. Come on now, rip out a
cheer!”
</p>
<p>
Under the lash of the words, the boys and girls
of Rivertown let out cheer after cheer, winding
up the various school cries with the names of the
boys who were to represent it’s honor.
</p>
<p>
Valiantly, Springtown came back, but not
enough scholars had come down the river to produce
a volume as great as that of the home town,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
and they finally abandoned their efforts to out-cheer
their rivals.
</p>
<p>
The preliminaries having been arranged while
the battle of voices was being fought out, the
student leaders had drawn a line on the ice from
one of the old landmarks which had been used on
the river for the races between the two schools
for generations, while three or four others started
up the ice to stand the stakes at the finish line,
which was also indicated by long established posts.
</p>
<p>
As soon as the latter had taken their position,
the contestants were lined up.
</p>
<p>
Having lost the choice of distance, according
to the traditions of the races between the two
schools, the task of starting the race fell to
Springtown, and Dick Wenzel, the captain of the
baseball team, was proclaimed the man to give
the word.
</p>
<p>
Separating into groups which lined up, each
about their representatives, the scholars again
gave vent to cheers, and when they finally subsided,
Wenzel warned the racers to be ready, then
sent them away.
</p>
<p>
During the time that they were waiting, Paul
and Jerry had posted Harry as well as they could
on the tricks of their opponents; and the three
boys had come to the conclusion that inasmuch as
the race was to be for two miles, it would be best
to let the visitors set the pace.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
</p>
<p>
The boys from the head of the river, however,
quickly fell to the game and slackened their speed.
</p>
<p>
“Wake up! Put some ginger into it. This
isn’t a walking match!” shouted the boys and girls
who were following the contestants, irrespective of
the schools to which they belonged.
</p>
<p>
During the first few hundred yards, Harry had
sized up his opponents closely, noting from the
short strokes they took, that while they could
maintain a high rate of speed for a short distance,
they were more than likely to exhaust themselves
before they could go the two miles; and when he
heard the taunts of his schoolmates, he decided
to take a chance of being outskated by the rivals
of Rivertown.
</p>
<p>
All six of the boys were skating along leisurely,
when of a sudden Harry put on a burst of speed,
shooting to the front; and before the others had
realized what had happened he had opened a
space of fifty feet between him and his competitors.
</p>
<p>
“After him! After him! Don’t let him get
too much of a lead on you,” warned the Springtown
students, dismayed to think anyone could
make such a gain on their representatives.
</p>
<p>
The glee of the Rivertown scholars was in proportion
to the anxiety of their rivals.
</p>
<p>
But though the representatives of Springtown
responded to the demands of their mates, Harry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
had a flying lead and, exert themselves as they
would, the boys from up the river could not gain
on him.
</p>
<p>
His arms and feet swinging in perfect rhythm,
Harry sped over the smooth ice, the shouts of his
schoolmates ringing in his ears.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got a good lead, slow up!” shouted
those of his mates who were nearest to him, while
others cautioned him to take it easy, in the fear
that he could not last the full distance. But the
boy knew himself better than they, and kept on at
his top speed, unmindful of their advice.
</p>
<p>
Hard behind him came a Springtown skater, but
could not cut down his lead appreciably.
</p>
<p>
Barely able to hold their own with the others,
Paul and Jerry struggled along, and as they saw
that their chum had so great an advantage they
devoted their energies to coaching him.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got them all puffing, and there’s only
a quarter more to go! There isn’t one of them
who can spurt! Just take care of yourself and
don’t fall!” they shouted from time to time.
</p>
<p>
As the cries reached his ears, Harry raised his
head, looked for the finish line, and to his delight
saw it even nearer than he supposed.
</p>
<p>
The sight made him feel so happy that he determined
to give a still greater exhibition of his
speed; and striking out as though he were perfectly
fresh, instead of having skated more than a mile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
and three-quarters, he raced over the ice, opening
farther and farther the distance that separated
him from his Springtown rivals.
</p>
<p>
His spurt had been greeted with gasps of surprise
from his schoolmates, and many were the
shouts hurled at him to be careful lest he exhaust
himself and get beaten out at the finish. When
they saw he was skating strong and steadily, however,
the Rivertown boys and girls gave vent to
the wildest glee, and howled and cheered, breaking
their schools yells with rhythmic chants of:
</p>
<p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—HARRY RECEIVES BAD NEWS</h2>
<p>
As Harry dashed across the line, victor, pandemonium
broke loose among the scholars; and
when they overtook him he was given an ovation
that entirely drove from his mind the unpleasant
incidents of the morning and early afternoon.
</p>
<p>
Foremost in congratulations was Viola, and
after his friends had thanked him for upholding
the honor of Rivertown, and wresting the victory
of the annual race from their old time Springtown
rivals, Harry and Viola started down the
river together.
</p>
<p>
They had covered about half the distance, when
Elmer and Pud put in their appearance. Disagreeable,
indeed, were the comments which the
rich boy made when he saw the one member of
the Rivertown High School he most detested
skating with the girl he liked the best.
</p>
<p>
In vain Viola pretended not to hear the remarks
passed by the bully and his companion, but
they brought a flush of anger to her cheeks, and
noting it, Harry let go her hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
</p>
<p>
“If you’re tired, Miss Darrow, suppose we
wait till the others come up. Then you can skate
away with your friends,” suggested Harry.
</p>
<p>
A moment the girl looked at him: “I’m not in
the least tired, Mr. Watson!” she exclaimed;
“and I don’t mind what those two boys are saying,
if you don’t.”
</p>
<p>
“But I do,” returned Harry, “on your account.
For that reason I think it’s best that you join
your friends.”
</p>
<p>
“But you’re <em>my</em> friend, aren’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“I hope so, that is, I should like to be.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I certainly consider you so,” returned
the girl, and again taking hold of hands, they
skated away, laughing and chatting merrily; and
continued to skate together till it was time for
them to go to their homes to supper.
</p>
<p>
Light of heart to think he had been cleared of
the charges of depredations in the physical laboratory,
and successful in defeating the skaters from
Springtown, Harry was in a happy frame of mind
as he mounted the steps of his aunt’s house, and
went in to supper. But one sight of his aunt’s
face drove all his joy away.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Aunt Mary? Have you heard
about the trouble at the school? Don’t worry,
because there’s nothing in it.”
</p>
<p>
The thought that her nephew had been concerned
in some difficulty of which she was ignorant struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
still further grievance to the woman.
</p>
<p>
“No, I haven’t heard about it. What is it,
tell me?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it doesn’t amount to much. Merely that
some apparatus was broken in the physical laboratory
and they thought that I did it.”
</p>
<p>
So distressed was the woman that, unmindful
of how the words would sound, and the impression
they would convey, she asked in a tone that was
harsher than she would have used if she had been
entirely herself.
</p>
<p>
“You didn’t do it, did you?”
</p>
<p>
In surprise, Harry looked at her for several
moments.
</p>
<p>
“No, indeed,” he finally replied.
</p>
<p>
“Thank goodness. We have trouble enough
without that.”
</p>
<p>
Never before had the boy seen his aunt so upset,
and her asperity was all the more striking because
of her usual kindly humor.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the trouble? Tell me, Aunt Mary,
please?” he finally asked.
</p>
<p>
“It’s bad news, Harry.”
</p>
<p>
Instantly the boy became as solemn and serious
as his aunt. His face grew white and the lines
about his mouth grew deep.
</p>
<p>
“You mean you’ve had bad news from
father?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
</p>
<p>
“Poor dad! I guess I’d better give up school
and go back to Lawrenceburgh,” announced the
boy. “If Elmer and Pud ever hear about it,
they’ll make my life unbearable; and besides, it
isn’t right for me to be such a drain on father.”
</p>
<p>
“You won’t be a drain on him. You mustn’t
look at it that way!” exclaimed his aunt. “You
know you are just as dear to me as though you
were my own son, and I want you to stay with
me <em>now</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“But somebody ought to go down to Lawrenceburgh.
It can’t be true. There’s something
wrong somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“Somebody <em>is</em> going down to Lawrenceburgh!”
announced a shrill voice.
</p>
<p>
And looking up, Mrs. Watson and her nephew
beheld the kindly face of old Jed Brown, whose
usual happy smile had given way to an expression
of solemnity.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” asked Mrs. Watson.
</p>
<p>
“That I’m going down to Lawrenceburgh for
a few days. I’ve been wanting to go for a long
time. Just been looking for an excuse and now
I’ve got it. I’ve known Amos since he was a kid
in knickerbockers, and I know there isn’t a mean
or crooked hair in his head. It’s all a mistake—and
and I’m going to set it right.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mr. Brown! If you only could!” exclaimed the widow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
as the old veteran ceased
speaking.
</p>
<p>
“And I can. Don’t worry,” he returned. “It
may take some time, but I shall find out who’s at
the bottom of it, and even if Jed Brown is a cripple
and poor, he is honest, and he can fight just
as in the days when he followed the flag through
the campaign in the Wilderness.”
</p>
<p>
So deeply moved were the aunt and nephew,
they dared not speak in the fear that they would
be unable to control their voices, and they expressed
their appreciation of the old veteran’s
words by shaking his hand cordially.
</p>
<p>
Sad, indeed, was the little household during the
rest of the day, and as soon as Harry could find an
excuse he went to his room and to bed, where,
after forming various plans for the undoing of
his father’s enemies, he finally dropped asleep.
</p>
<p>
“Now you must try to forget that things are
not as they always were,” whispered his aunt
in the boy’s ear as he started for school the next
morning. “Just appear your usual self, and do
not let any of your friends know that you are not
happy.”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t my friends I’m afraid of; it’s the fellows
who don’t like me,” returned Harry.
</p>
<p>
“All the more reason why you should keep a
stiff upper lip,” declared Mrs. Watson. And,
promising to do his best, the boy set out for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
bluff on which the Rivertown High School was,
situated.
</p>
<p>
But it seemed as though Fate had conspired
against Harry!
</p>
<p>
As he entered the main hallway, Elmer stepped
up, having evidently been on the lookout for him.
</p>
<p>
“See here, Watson, I saw you skating with
Viola Darrow yesterday afternoon!” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what of it?”
</p>
<p>
“Just this much—don’t do it again!”
</p>
<p>
“Why not, pray?”
</p>
<p>
“Because I tell you not to, that’s all!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you’ve got to give me some better reason
than that, Elmer Craven,” flashed the sorely
troubled boy. “If Miss Darrow is willing that I
should skate with her, I don’t see that it is your
business or anyone else’s, as far as that is concerned.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll find it is, though. I tell you, you’ve got
to stop going with her! You remember the laboratory
business? Well, it will be just as easy to
put a stop to your going with Viola as it was to
frame that up on you. So just take my advice
and leave her alone!”
</p>
<p>
So vicious did the rich boy’s face become as he
uttered his threat that Harry could scarcely believe
he was talking with a fellow member of Rivertown
High. For the moment, he thought of resenting the boy’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
words with his fists; but the
sound of footsteps and the voice of the principal,
from behind, caused him to abandon the idea.
</p>
<p>
“Well, are you going to take my advice?” demanded
his enemy, sullenly.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to do just as I please, Elmer Craven.
Neither you nor anyone else can stop me!”
retorted Harry. And turning on his heel, he
stalked away to his classroom.
</p>
<p>
But though he had maintained a defiant manner,
at heart he was sick. Coming as it did on
top of the news from his father, the thought that
he would now be obliged to guard himself against
underhand attacks from his rival, with whom he
had held many angry words, made him deeply
anxious, and again the idea which had come to him
on the previous night when his aunt had made
her announcement,—that he should leave school,—recurred
to him.
</p>
<p>
A happy nod and smile from Viola, who
chanced to be passing through the hall on her way
to one of her recitations, however, decided the day
for Harry.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll not let Elmer Craven make me give up
my friendship for Viola!” he told himself. And
with this resolve, he proceeded to his various duties.
</p>
<p>
Having no recitations after the noon recess,
Paul suggested that Jerry, Harry and he should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
take a sail on his new iceboat <em>Lightning</em>, which
had just been delivered to him.
</p>
<p>
Glad of any diversion that would take his
mind from his troubles, Harry readily accepted
and the boys went to their several homes for dinner.
</p>
<p>
Angry that he had failed to scare his rival, Elmer
had brooded all the morning over some means
of making good his threat, and at last, unable to
think of any scheme that would be both adequate
and feasible, he dropped into the village butcher
shop to consult his friend, Pud.
</p>
<p>
To his amazement, he found the bully laughing
and in high spirits, in striking contrast to the surly
gloom he had maintained since the eventful day
in Lumberport.
</p>
<p>
“What’s making you feel so gay?” demanded
Elmer.
</p>
<p>
“The fact that I’ve got Harry Watson now
just where I want him!”
</p>
<p>
His eyes big with incredulity, the richest boy
in Rivertown stared at the bully.
</p>
<p>
“What on earth do you mean?” he finally
asked, when he found that Pud made no move to
explain his statement.
</p>
<p>
“Just this!” returned the bully. And he tapped
a newspaper which was spread out over one of the
chopping blocks.
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t understand?” persisted Elmer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then listen to this!” and Pud read the following:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“‘Amos Watson’s appeal was denied by the
court and he will now be compelled to serve five
years in prison to which he was sentenced for forgery.’”
</p>
<p>
“Well?” exclaimed Elmer, still mystified.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with you? Have you suddenly
lost your senses?” stormed the bully.
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t see what that has to do with that
young cur.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t, eh? Well, it has just this to do
with it—Amos Watson is Harry’s father!”
</p>
<p>
For several minutes the rich boy stood silent,
as though endeavoring to grasp the magnitude
of the news which had come to him—and then,
with a sudden cry of delight, he struck Pud a resounding
whack on the back.
</p>
<p>
“That’s great—provided it’s true!” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“True? Of course it’s true. Isn’t it in the
paper?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but where did you get the paper?” demanded
Elmer, picking it up and looking at the
name and date line.
</p>
<p>
“Uncle Briscoe always sends it up from Lawrenceburgh
to my mother. She used to live down
there, you know.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, I didn’t, but the paper seems straight
enough, so I suppose it’s all right.”
</p>
<p>
“You bet it’s all right. And now come on,
we’ll spread the news—and if Harry Watson
doesn’t wish before night he’d never been born,
I’ll miss my guess!”
</p>
<p>
And together the two boys who hated Harry
so bitterly set out to scatter the news of his
father’s misfortune broadcast.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—ELMER BAITS HIS RIVAL</h2>
<p>
Good care did the two boys who were bent on
the downfall of our hero take to tell the story of
Harry’s father being a forger only to those who
were not particularly friendly to the lad—with
the result that it found ready credence, and was
soon being repeated with all manner of exaggerations.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe a word of it!” declared Viola,
when the report reached her. “Harry Watson is
a splendid chap. I——”
</p>
<p>
“But this isn’t Harry, it’s his father whose
appeal from a prison sentence has been refused,”
laughed a girl who had told the malicious tale.
</p>
<p>
“It makes no difference, I don’t believe Harry’s
father is a man who would stoop to any such act!”
retorted Viola, hotly. And, putting her arm
through Nettie’s, the richest girl in Rivertown
High went off with her chum—for the story had
hurt her more than she cared to have her schoolmates
see.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
</p>
<p>
Though in high spirits at the amazement their
announcement caused among their schoolmates,
Elmer and Pud were disappointed that the boy
whose father they were traducing did not put in
an appearance.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you suppose he is?” asked Socker,
after they had discovered Harry’s absence.
</p>
<p>
“Probably afraid to show his head,” commented
Misery. “I don’t think I’d care to exhibit
myself to my school-fellows under such conditions.”
</p>
<p>
“But Jerry and Paul aren’t here, either,” asserted
another boy.
</p>
<p>
“The three of them are off together somewhere,
I suppose,” suggested Pud.
</p>
<p>
“Or else they’re waiting until school begins,
to sneak in,” commented Elmer.
</p>
<p>
But in ignorance of all the cruel things that
were being said about him, Harry was at the
river with his chums, busily helping Paul rig up
his iceboat.
</p>
<p>
Being new, there was no end of fussing and
readjusting to be done before the <em>Lightning</em> was
ready for her initial spin; and the three lads were
in the act of making a final test of her ropes, when
a crowd of the boys and girls rushed down to the
river for their daily frolic on the ice after school—and
among them were Elmer and Pud.
</p>
<p>
“Who’s iceboat is that?” demanded the bully,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
as he caught sight of the rangy looking craft,
some half mile up the river.
</p>
<p>
“Must belong to some one from Lumberport
or Cardell,” returned Elmer. “It’s a new one,
that’s easy to see. Let’s skate out and look her
over. If she’s any good, I’ll rig up the <em>Glider</em>
and we’ll have some races.”
</p>
<p>
Readily the other boys agreed to the suggestion,
and as soon as they had adjusted their skates,
they dashed out over the smooth, clear ice.
</p>
<p>
Not far had they gone, however, before Pud let
out a whoop of glee.
</p>
<p>
“That’s Paul Martin; and he’s got Jerry and
Watson with him!” he shouted. “Come on, we’ll
have some fun with the forger’s son!”
</p>
<p>
The evident viciousness of the bully did not
meet with the approval of some of the fellows,
however, and they were not slow to let Snooks
know it. But the thought that he had a lever with
which to make his enemy unhappy made him impervious
to any comments of his schoolmates.
</p>
<p>
Ere the boys had covered more than half the
distance which separated them from the iceboat
they saw that unless something were done instantly
to delay the start, they would arrive too
late, for Paul and his companions were stretching
themselves along the runners, preparatory to getting
under way.
</p>
<p>
“Hey there! Wait a minute!” yelled Elmer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
putting his hands to his lips that he might make a
funnel that would carry the sound farther.
</p>
<p>
Surprised at the hail, the three boys rolled from
the iceboat, looking expectantly at the fellows
hastening toward them.
</p>
<p>
“What’s wanted?” shouted Paul, as the others
came within easy speaking distance.
</p>
<p>
“I just wanted to tell you that the fellow you’re
chumming with and going to take on your boat
is the son of a prison-bird!” exclaimed Elmer.
“I thought you ought to know it.”
</p>
<p>
As he heard the brutal statement, Harry’s face
grew deathly pale, and he clutched one of the
guide ropes with his hand as though to keep himself
from falling, while Paul and Jerry looked
from his accuser to him, bewildered.
</p>
<p>
“Wha—what do you mean?” finally stammered
Paul. “Who’s the son of a prison-bird?”
</p>
<p>
“Harry Watson!” chorused Elmer and Pud.
</p>
<p>
“That’s not true!” cried Harry, in a quavering
voice.
</p>
<p>
“It is! My mother received a paper from
Lawrenceburgh this morning, and it says that
Amos Watson is going to prison for five years
for forgery!” announced the bully, gloatingly.
</p>
<p>
“And Amos Watson is your father, isn’t he?”
demanded Elmer of Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. But there has been some dirty work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
somewhere. My father is as innocent of the
charge as you are, Elmer Craven!”
</p>
<p>
“Evidently the judge didn’t think so—or he
wouldn’t have refused his appeal,” sneered the
rich tormentor. “Before you get chummy with
any more fellows, I advise you to make sure who
they are, Paul. And you remember it was you
who introduced this son of a prison-bird to Viola.”
</p>
<p>
At the mention of the girl’s name, Harry
seemed suddenly to galvanize into action.
</p>
<p>
“You leave Miss Darrow’s name out of this,
Elmer Craven!” he cried, hotly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, is that so? Well, I reckon it will take
more than a forger’s son to tell me what I shall
do and what I shall not. Paul, you’ve either
got to apologize to Viola for introducing this
chap to her—or——”
</p>
<p>
“Or what?” demanded Harry, fairly leaping
on his skates toward the boy who had been baiting
him until he had goaded him beyond endurance.
</p>
<p>
Something there was in the tormented boy’s
eyes that alarmed his rich enemy, and the fellow
gave ground, working himself toward the spot
where Pud Snooks was standing, as though seeking
the protection of the bully.
</p>
<p>
Harry, however, was too quick for him and,
with a sudden turn cut off Elmer’s attempt, forcing
the boy to face him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
</p>
<p>
“Or what?” he demanded a second time.
</p>
<p>
Finding escape impossible, the rich fellow
glared into the white, tense face before him.
</p>
<p>
“Or he’ll have to settle with me!” Elmer finished,
but his voice was so low that it carried none
of its former bravado.
</p>
<p>
“You’re wrong there, Craven. He’ll be obliged
to settle with me if he does apologize. I may not
be as rich as you, nor my father as yours, but
we’re just as honest!”
</p>
<p>
“That doesn’t seem to be what the judge
thought!” repeated Elmer. “I——”
</p>
<p>
But the limit of insult that Harry could endure
had been reached.
</p>
<p>
After the repetition of the remark about the
opinion of the jurist who had denied Mr. Watson’s
appeal, the boy had drawn back his right
arm—and the next moment, his tormentor lay
stretched on the ice!
</p>
<p>
“Coward! Why don’t you take a fellow of
your size!” cried Pud, skating toward Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you?” demanded Paul and Jerry,
throwing themselves between the hulking bully
who overtopped their chum by three or four
inches.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing in this? Get out of my
way!” snarled Snooks.
</p>
<p>
But the two boys refused to budge and, realizing
that he would not be a match for the pair of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
them, the bully skated away, growling to himself.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Elmer had gotten to his feet.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll fix you for this, you see if I don’t!” he
snarled with a look of fierce hatred at the boy
who had knocked him down.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t, if I were you, Elmer. You only
got what you deserved!” returned Paul. “Come
on, Harry, if we’re going to have our sail on the
<em>Lightning</em>, we’ve got to hurry.”
</p>
<p>
“Much obliged—but I don’t think I’ll go this
afternoon,” exclaimed our hero; and despite the
protests of his chums, he skated to the shore and
then for home.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—DARK DAYS</h2>
<p>
On his way to his aunt’s house, Harry met
Jed Brown, hobbling along, a valise in his hand.
</p>
<p>
One look at the boy’s white face told the veteran
that some new trouble had come to him, and
he solicitously inquired its cause.
</p>
<p>
Harry, however, was not disposed to share his
grief with anyone.
</p>
<p>
“Going away?” he asked, warding off the question.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, down to my sister’s at Lawrenceburgh.
You know I told you and Mrs. Watson the other
night that I was going down—and this afternoon
we were talking it over and decided that if I was
to do any good, I ought to start without delay.”
</p>
<p>
For a moment Harry was silent as he strove to
master himself sufficiently to speak about his
father’s dilemma.
</p>
<p>
“I—I hope you’ll be able to find out something,
Jed,” he said, but his voice quavered pitifully and
as he heard it, a light of understanding broke
over the aged cripple.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
</p>
<p>
“Have the boys found out about the business?”
he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“How?”
</p>
<p>
“Pud Snooks saw the announcement of the
court in a paper that is sent to his mother from
Lawrenceburgh.”
</p>
<p>
At the mention of the source of the information,
the veteran’s brow clouded.
</p>
<p>
“That Snooks had better watch out!” he
snapped. “I—” then he evidently thought better
of his intention to say anything further concerning
the bully; and taking Harry’s hand, he exclaimed:
“Just keep good courage in your heart, boy.
Things will come out all right. Go about your
study and play exactly as though nothing had happened.
I’ll let you hear from me in a few days.
And now I must go or I shall miss my train.”
</p>
<p>
And giving the boy’s hand another hearty shake,
the crippled veteran started again on his way to
the railroad station.
</p>
<p>
Not more than a few steps had he taken, however,
then he felt a hand on his valise, and turning
quickly, in the fear that it might be some of
the boys who delighted to play tricks on him, he
had a snarl on his lips, when he saw that it was
Harry.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go down to the station with you, Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
Brown,” he announced. “Just let me take your
valise.”
</p>
<p>
Glad of the assistance, for he had found his
bag heavier than he thought, the veteran held the
conversation to cheerful topics, and not again was
the unfortunate matter, so close to the hearts of
both, mentioned. And waiting until the train
departed, Harry took his way home.
</p>
<p>
But he was not as bereft of friends as he had
thought.
</p>
<p>
No sooner had he taken his departure from the
river than the boys who had gathered about the
iceboat took up the discussion of the affair.
</p>
<p>
“Well, even if Mr. Watson does go to jail,
that doesn’t mean we should throw Harry down!”
announced Paul, resolutely.
</p>
<p>
Quickly several of the other boys reiterated this
opinion, but more of them sided with Elmer and
Pud.
</p>
<p>
“You can associate with him if you want to—but
I don’t think your father will let you,” sneered
the rich lad.
</p>
<p>
“I know mine won’t,” declared the bully. But
instead of his words making the impression he
had intended, they drew a burst of laughter from
Paul and Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“What do you find so funny about that?” demanded
Pud, angrily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
</p>
<p>
“That your father should forbid your associating
with anyone,” returned Paul.
</p>
<p>
“Say, do you think I ain’t as good as the Martins
or the Posts or any people in Rivertown?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not saying anything about that. It merely
struck me that a fellow who was only saved from
serious trouble by the kindheartedness of an old
man whom he had tormented in every way possible
ought not to make too many comments about
other people,” exclaimed Paul, coolly, but uttering
each word with deliberation.
</p>
<p>
Instantly the boys realized that Paul had referred
to the incident of the fire which burned Jed
Brown’s home, and they awaited the effect upon
the bully with eagerness. But it was not what
they expected.
</p>
<p>
For a moment, Pud looked into the eyes of the
boy who had taken up the cudgels for his absent
chum; then lowered his own, growled something
that none of his auditors could understand, and
skated away.
</p>
<p>
“Now you go, too, Craven,” advised Jerry.
“If I were you, I’d hire Pud to go round with me—or
else stop talking about Harry Watson.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” demanded the rich
student.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t I make myself plain enough? I said
for you to stop talking about Harry Watson.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh, I’d like to see anyone stop me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, you will, if you don’t watch out.”
</p>
<p>
At the words, Craven skated away from Jerry,
evidently mindful of the blow he had received
from Harry; and with one accord, the excited
crowd of boys broke into small groups whose sole
topic of conversation was the news from Lawrenceburgh.
</p>
<p>
Among the townsfolk as well as the scholars,
the story spread, and in due time Mr. Larmore
and all the teachers heard of it.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t belief it!” announced Prof. Schmidt,
emphatically, when it was told him at supper.
And when he had finished the meal, the kindly old
German put on his fur coat and cap and went
round to call on Mrs. Watson.
</p>
<p>
The coming of the professor was distinctly embarrassing
to both the good woman and her
nephew. But he soon put them at their ease by
announcing that he hoped Harry would not let the
matter keep him from school.
</p>
<p>
“That’s just what we were talking about when
you came, Professor,” declared Mrs. Watson.
</p>
<p>
A ring at the door-bell interrupted her and
when Harry answered it and admitted the principal
of the Rivertown High School, she became
even more confused.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Larmore, however, quickly made it evident
that he had come for the same purpose as
had the genial old German; and after much talking,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
Mrs. Watson finally agreed that her nephew
should continue his studies.
</p>
<p>
But it was a quiet and sober Harry who entered
his classroom the next morning.
</p>
<p>
His friends strove to convey their sympathy
and belief in him by cordial nods. But their kindness
was more than offset by the sneers and grunts
with which his enemies greeted him. So keenly
did the boy feel them that he made his laboratory
work an excuse for not joining his companions
during the recesses.
</p>
<p>
What hurt him most, however, was Viola’s attitude.
Though she had smiled at him when he had
entered the classroom, when he had tried to speak
to her she had skilfully prevented it by moving
away when she saw him approaching. And deeply
did her action cut Harry, so that he vowed to himself
he would not give her another opportunity to
cause him pain.
</p>
<p>
For some time things drifted along, and Harry
continued to be the storm center of the school
world. Some of his fellows shunned him, and
others tried to establish themselves on even a
more friendly footing with him than at first. But
Harry’s attitude was neutral, his only decided
stand being to refuse to appear in the Pi Eta
society room, though his friends endeavored in
every way to persuade him.
</p>
<p>
During that time old Jed Brown did not return
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
to Rivertown, nor did our hero hear from the old
veteran. Harry’s aunt heard from Mr. Watson,
but the news was not encouraging.
</p>
<p>
“They still consider your father guilty,” said
the aunt to the youth. “But we know he is innocent,
and some day the world will know it, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” said Harry, sadly. “But, oh, Aunt
Mary, to have him in prison! It is awful! I can’t
bear to think of it!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—A MILE A MINUTE SPIN</h2>
<p>
“Good morning, Mrs. Watson; is Harry at
home?”
</p>
<p>
Saturday had come, with clear skies, and a cold,
crisp air that gave promise of a fine day’s sport
on the ice for Rivertown’s young people. It was
Paul Martin who had knocked at the door of the
widow’s house, and greeted her with his cheery
smile when she admitted him.
</p>
<p>
“Good morning, Paul!” replied the good
woman, the look of distress on her face giving
way for a moment to one of pleasure at seeing
this loyal friend of her nephew. “Yes, he is in
his den, busy with something. The poor boy seldom
goes out these days; and I’m afraid the constant
grieving will tell on his health.”
</p>
<p>
“That is just why I’ve come around, ma’am,
to try and influence Harry to take a spin with me
on my iceboat,” Paul continued, eagerly. “You
see, we were just going to have a run before,
when Pud Snooks interrupted us with that unpleasant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
bit of news; and Harry backed out.
We lost all interest in the sport soon afterward,
and I’ve really had little heart for it since.”
</p>
<p>
“It was good of you to think of your friend
in this way, Paul,” the widow said, laying a hand
on the lad’s shoulder, and looking affectionately
into his manly face. “And depend on it, Harry
is worthy of all your regard. I know something
about boys, even though I was never blessed with
one myself; and if ever there lived a clean, brave
and loyal fellow, Harry is one. And Paul, he
must go off with you to get some fresh air. This
staying in, and thinking of all his troubles, is
not the best thing for even his strong nature.”
</p>
<p>
“Then please back me up,” said Paul, “in
case he tries to beg off. I’m going to insist; and
I think I know how to reach Harry’s weak spot.
I’ll give him to understand that if he refuses, it’s
going to spoil all my Saturday morning sport.
Harry will make sacrifices for a chum that he
would never think of doing for himself. And now
I’ll push in on him, if you don’t mind.”
</p>
<p>
As he opened the door of Harry’s little den,
where the boy did his studying, and kept such
traps as boys usually accumulate, he found the
object of his solicitude bending over a table, and
deep in some book.
</p>
<p>
“Hello! here, old book-worm, this is no morning
to bury yourself here indoors like a hermit!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
cried Paul, as he burst in on his chum like a
breath of the crisp winter air.
</p>
<p>
Harry looked up, and his face was immediately
wreathed in a smile. The very presence of such
a fine, healthy fellow like Paul was enough in itself
to chase away the blues. He sprang to his
feet, and grasped the hand that was thrust out
toward him, wringing it with boyish ardor. For
deep down in his heart he knew full well that Paul
was almost as much concerned over the trouble
that had of late befallen him, as he could be himself.
</p>
<p>
“Glad to see you, Paul!” he exclaimed. “Yes,
it does look like a great day for a Saturday; and
I guess lots of fellows will be glad. The ice
must be fine after that little thaw, and hard
freeze. I haven’t been down to the river you
know, of late. I just seem to feel that I ought
to keep away from my friends, and save them
from embarrassment.”
</p>
<p>
If there was a trace of bitterness in Harry’s
voice, Paul did not notice it. He did catch the
tremor though, that told of a sore heart; and
impulsively he again squeezed the hand of his
chum.
</p>
<p>
“That’s just what brought me here right now,”
he observed, seriously. “You must get out more,
Harry. You know yourself that all this brooding
over your affairs isn’t going to do you a bit of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
good. Things are going to come out all right yet;
but it may take some time. Meanwhile it’s foolish
of you to shun your best friends, and keep
indoors. I’ve come to carry you off to the river
with me, d’ye hear?”
</p>
<p>
Harry sighed, and cast a look of sincere affection
on this staunch friend. They had been utter
strangers only a few months back; and yet so
strong had the ties become that bound them together,
that he fancied he cared as much for
Paul as he could have done for a brother.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Paul,” he said, slowly. “I’d
like to go first-rate; but I’ve made up my mind
to keep clear of all the high school young people
until this mystery is solved, and I can look them
in the face without a blush. Understand, I have
the utmost faith in my father; and I <em>know</em> he must
be innocent of the charge brought against him;
but so far old Jed has not sent any cheering word;
and I must wait.”
</p>
<p>
“But I say again, that’s no reason for you to
keep on hurting your health,” Paul insisted.
“Even your Aunt Mary is getting anxious about
you; and Harry, she’s been so good to you, don’t
you think it is a little cruel to add to her burden
in any way?”
</p>
<p>
Harry sighed again, and looked undecided.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Aunt Mary is as good as gold,” he observed.
“And I certainly wouldn’t want to cause
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
her any unnecessary pain; but Paul, somehow I
haven’t the heart to do the things I used to. I
feel a terrible weight in here,”—putting his hand
on his chest as he spoke—“that hurts. In my present
condition I’d only be a drawback to any crowd
of merry boys and girls; and so I stay away.”
</p>
<p>
Perhaps Paul could understand more than
Harry gave him credit for. Perhaps he guessed
that it was partly the coolness of one particular
girl that helped give his chum this heavy feeling
in the region of his heart. For he knew how
much Harry had come to care for Viola; and it
was difficult for him to understand just why she
should take up again with Elmer Craven, whom
she had once cut dead.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” he said cheerily; “for once, then,
you’ve just got to put that idea out of your head,
and come along with me, Harry. Your aunt
says you must, and insists that I carry you off to
get a few hours of bracing air. And yet, if you’d
rather stay here in your den to being in my company,
why——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! you know better than that, Paul!” cried
the other lad eagerly, as he looked into the face
of his friend. “I’ve enjoyed many happy hours
in your company; and if it wasn’t for this unfortunate
business——”
</p>
<p>
“That’s enough, Harry,” and Paul in turn
broke in on what the forlorn boy was trying to say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
in a trembling voice; “you’ve just got to come
along now, or else all my plans for the morning
will be broken up. I’d arranged for the two of
us, no others, mind, to take my new iceboat,
<em>Lightning</em>, and have a great spin far up the river.
The ice couldn’t be beat; and I’m determined that
it’s just got to be <em>you</em> with me, or no one. That’s
flat. Now, what do you say?”
</p>
<p>
Harry smiled with pleasure. It was almost
worth suffering all that he had endured in these
last few unhappy days, just to learn what a true
friend meant.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you put it up to me in a way that
knocks out all my argument,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Then you’ll come with me?” demanded Paul,
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Sure I will, and mighty glad of the chance,”
Harry replied, as he started to look for his cap,
and his warm sweater to go under his coat; for
he knew that a long ride on an iceboat, going a
mile a minute more than likely, meant chilled
bodies, unless care was taken to supply warm
clothing.
</p>
<p>
Once he had decided on his course, Harry
seemed somewhat like his old self. Mrs. Watson,
as they passed through the outer room, smiled,
and nodded to Paul.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad to see you managed to coax him to
go, Paul,” she remarked; and both lads waved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
her good-bye as they left the door, walking briskly
down the street of Rivertown.
</p>
<p>
Paul’s father had a boat-house on the bank of
the river just outside the town limits, where in
Summer the boys often gathered in order to enjoy
the sports of the season. There was a new shed
attached to this, in which Paul kept the iceboat
he had had built recently, but which had as yet
hardly been tried out.
</p>
<p>
In a short time the two lads were busily engaged
getting the frail craft out of its quarters,
and down on the ice. The mast had to be stepped
every time Paul wished to make use of the flier;
since the shed was too low to admit of its being
stored as it stood. But this proved a job of small
moment.
</p>
<p>
“I guess you know a heap about these kind of
boats, Harry?” remarked the owner of the
<em>Lightning</em>, as he watched the deft manner in which
his new chum handled the various ropes connected
with the up-to-date craft built for ice use.
</p>
<p>
At that Harry laughed, the first little burst of
merriment that had escaped his lips for days; and
which made his friend feel that he had done well
to coax the grieving lad outdoors, where he could
get the invigorating influence of the ozone to be
found in the crisp wintry air.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! yes, I suppose I might say I have, without
seeming to boast,” he answered, as he bent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
down to make sure that everything was adjusted,
and the wire stay that held the mast in place as
taut as the turnbuckle could make it. “We used
to have a boat down at Lawrenceburgh, and somehow
they got to making me the skipper; last winter
we won every race we entered for. But Paul,
that boat wasn’t in the same class as this new one
you’ve got, I tell you that.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you think the <em>Lightning</em> is apt to go
some?” inquired the owner, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Do I?” echoed Harry, quickly. “Unless
I’m away off in my judgment, she’s bound to beat
everything along the river. I never saw such
fine lines; and best of all, I don’t think the builder
has sacrificed anything in the way of staunchness
to speed. Mark my word, Paul, she’s going to
turn out a crackerjack!”
</p>
<p>
“I’m mighty glad to hear that, Harry!” declared
Paul, “for a good many reasons. A fellow
likes to have a clipper boat, you know, one
that isn’t going to take dust from any other chap’s
racer. And then, it would just give me heaps of
fun if I could leave the old <em>Glider</em> far back in
the lurch.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s Elmer’s iceboat, isn’t it?” asked
Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Sure. He hasn’t had it out this winter, I understand,
because for two years now it’s just run
away from everything there was; and Elmer said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
he was tired of making circles around the rest of
us. But three times now he’s asked me when I
expected to get my new boat running; and as much
as told me he was waiting to add it to the has-beens
he’s beaten.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, don’t you believe he’s going to have an
easy job walking away from this dandy thing on
runners,” Harry observed. “I’m ready to say
that you’ve got the very last word in iceboats
here in the <em>Lightning</em>. And before another hour
has passed you’ll feel that you made no mistake
when you gave her that name. Now, if you’re
ready, let’s make a start.”
</p>
<p>
Harry was anxious to be off. He had noticed
that several boys and girls were heading toward
them, having skated up from below. And in his
present state of mind he would rather avoid
meeting any of his school companions if it could
be arranged.
</p>
<p>
“How about the wind?” asked Paul, as they
started to take their places on the thin but strong
planks of the iceboat, which had been padded
with folded blankets, so as to make it more comfortable
for those who had to stretch out at full
length while managing the running craft.
</p>
<p>
“It seems to be everything we could want this
morning,” Harry replied. “In fact, I don’t think
there ever was a day here on the Conoque River
better fitted for a try-out of a new iceboat than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
this same Saturday morning. And I’m glad now
that I came with you, Paul.”
</p>
<p>
“Bully for you, Harry! That’s all I wanted
to hear. And now, let’s cut loose before all those
fellows get in our way.”
</p>
<p>
Longback, Socker Gales, and Misery Jones
were among those coming full tilt for the spot
where they had discovered the new boat on the
river’s edge.
</p>
<p>
They gave vent to various whoops and cries
when they saw that Paul and Harry were starting
off without waiting for their arrival.
</p>
<p>
“Hi! aint you goin’ to let us have a look-in at
the new boat, before you smash her with that
Jonah aboard?”
</p>
<p>
“Listen, Paul! Just you keep right on up the
river, and my word for it you’ll get yours before
you come back!”
</p>
<p>
“Wow! look at her go, would you? Say, fellers,
she’s all to the mustard, you c’n tell me what
you please about the <em>Glider</em>. Paul knew what he
was doing when he gave the order for that dandy
contraption. Gee! don’t I wish I was on her
right now!”
</p>
<p>
These last words just barely reached the ears
of the two who lay flattened out on the delicate
flooring of the ice yacht. Harry heard his chum
chuckling, as if somehow the last remark had
given him a good feeling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
</p>
<p>
The skaters started after them, but were speedily
left far behind, and presently gave the chase up
as useless. And now the whole river lay before
the two iceboat chums, with not a single person
to interfere with their sport; since it was as a
rule farming country above Rivertown, on both
sides of the watercourse.
</p>
<p>
Few rivers offered better fields for this sport
than the Conoque. While not of any great depth,
it was as a rule quite wide; and in places presented
a magnificent spread of smooth, clear ice, over
which the sharp runners glided like magic, as the
favoring breeze filled their sail, and urged them
on at tremendous speed.
</p>
<p>
Then again, once in a while they would come
to a neck where the going was quite different,
since the ice was rougher, and they had to look
out for airholes. In the Summer season, when the
water was lower, these places were called the
“rips”; being in reality small rapids, where the
water rushed with noisy volume, and the fishing
was considered prime.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what d’ye think of that?” called out
Paul, after they had been booming along in this
manner for a little while, passing a couple of the
narrow places, where considerable care had to
be exercised to avoid trouble.
</p>
<p>
“Splendid! Never went like this before!
You’ve got a wonder here, Paul, and don’t you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
forget it,” answered Harry, whose face was now
rosy with the action of the keen wind and the
cold air; while his eyes sparkled much as they
had been wont to do before this trouble came
upon him, to crush his young spirits so completely.
</p>
<p>
“That pleases me a whole lot, Harry,” laughed
the owner of the craft. “And say, I’ve been
watching the way you handle that tiller. Elmer
Craven boasts of being the best iceboat sailor on
the river; but I’m ready to put you up against
him any old day. Why, you manage things so
that she seems to be next door to human. No
matter what sort of wind strikes us, you’ve got a
way of setting her with it, that just suits every
time. If this boat’s a wonder, Harry, you’re the
fellow that can get every ounce of speed out of
her.”
</p>
<p>
“Here, that will do for you, Paul,” answered
Harry; though naturally the words of genuine
praise made him feel happy, as he had been up
against so many hard knocks lately, at the hands
of those who bore him so much ill will. “I’d just
like to try her against some other boat of the same
class. That’s the only way to get a pointer on her
speed and cleverness, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps we may, and this very morning,”
remarked Paul, mysteriously, but with a grin accompanying
the words.
</p>
<p>
“What makes you say that?” demanded his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
companion, who had to keep his eyes on the
alert pretty much all the time, since a flaw of wind
might swoop down on them at any second, and if
he failed to be quick with the rudder, in order to
ease up on the sudden strain, an upset was likely
to follow.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t you hear what Misery Jones shouted
after us?” Paul went on, answering one question,
Yankee fashion, by asking another.
</p>
<p>
“Was it Misery who called out for you to listen;
and then said something about you ‘getting
yours’ if you kept on up the river?” Harry continued.
</p>
<p>
“Sure, that was Misery. He’s never so happy
as when acting as a prophet, and predicting all
sorts of trouble ahead for other people. That’s
why the boys call him Misery; he sees all kinds
of accidents looming up, even if they hardly ever
come along. But Harry, I don’t think the fellow
had any accident in store for us that time, when
he said I would get mine up here to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“Then what did he have in mind?” asked
Harry, his curiosity aroused.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been thinking it over,” Paul went on,
“and decided that Misery must know Elmer is out
this morning with his <em>Glider</em>; and somewhere up-river
way. What he meant was that if we happened
to run across his hawser, I would find my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
new iceboat as badly left in the lurch as my old
one was last year.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” laughed the one who handled the
tiller so dexterously; “all things are possible, you
know, Paul; but I wouldn’t worry over that, if I
were you. Just let Elmer show up, and we’ll see
what the <em>Lightning</em> was built for.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s a bunch of fellows coming down the
river,” said Paul, a minute later. “They live
some miles up at a village called Rushville. Several
of our high school scholars come down from
there every day on the train, you know. I was
going to say that if we could shut off some of
our tremendous speed, and draw in closer to them,
I might find out whether Elmer really did go up-river.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” responded Harry, readily; “that’s
easy enough done.”
</p>
<p>
He manipulated the tiller, and watched the
way the wind spilled out of the big sail as he ran
partly across the ice field, heading so as to intercept
the skaters. These boys, seeing that those
on the fine new iceboat wished to speak with them,
only too gladly came to a standstill, and watched
the clever way in which Harry managed to bring
his craft up in the teeth of the wind close beside
them.
</p>
<p>
“Hello! Paul, that your new boat?” cried one
of the up-river fellows, as he advanced to get a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
closer look at the now still <em>Lightning</em>. “Well, I
must say she’s got lines to go some, and then not
half try. Give you my word I never saw such a
trim and dandy iceboat; and I wish I had a chance
to take a spin on her with you.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you may, some of these fine days,
Hank,” remarked Paul with a grin; for he had
always been friendly with the Rushville student
at school. “Just now we’re out on the warpath,
looking for scalps, you see, and want to be on the
fly.”
</p>
<p>
The three boys looked at each other as though
hardly catching the true meaning of what Paul
said. But a moment later Hank laughed aloud
as the significance of the words appealed to him.
</p>
<p>
“Ho! I get it all right now, Paul!” he exclaimed,
nodding his head while speaking. “You
want to find something to whack your new boat
up against, eh? Well, what’s the matter with the
<em>Glider</em>? Elmer didn’t do a thing to you last winter,
if I remember right; and the spirit of revenge
must be rankling in your heart. Is that it?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps a little that way,” answered Paul,
frankly. “You know he’s got a nasty way of rubbing
it in every time he does anything; that stings
worse than the defeat itself does. I’ve never
heard the last of that race, and how nicely he
trimmed me. And to tell the honest truth, that
was why I went to all the trouble and expense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
of having this new craft built to order. I want
to turn the tables on him in the worst way.”
</p>
<p>
“Couldn’t have a better day for it!” nodded
Hank.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! the weather is all to the good,” declared
Paul, impatiently; “but see here, you fellows
have come down several miles—have you seen
anything of another iceboat between here and
Rushville?”
</p>
<p>
“Have we, fellows?” asked Hank, turning to
his two companions and winking. “Was that a
real iceboat that went whipping past us just after
we started out; or might it have been just a shadow
when a cloud passed over the sun? Yes, I
rather guess it did look like the sassy thing Elmer
used to cut circles with around all the other boats
on the river last two years.”
</p>
<p>
“Which way were they going did you say?”
asked Paul, giving his chum a significant look, as
if to say: “What did I tell you; didn’t I remark
that this was going to be a red letter day with me,
since it would wipe out the sting of that old defeat
at the hands of Elmer Craven, which I’ve never
heard the last of?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! up-river like a streak of light,” replied
Hank. “No use talking, that <em>Glider</em> can go to
beat the Dutch; and Elmer knows how to sail her
too, the best ever; but I like the looks of this new
craft, Paul, and from the way Harry handles the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
tiller I opine now that you’re just bound to give
Elmer the time of his life when you challenge him
to a race.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what we intend to do, Hank,” returned
Paul. “Much obliged for telling us about him.
We can keep going now till we scrape his acquaintance.
He’s been begging me for some time
to get out and let him rub some of the rust from
his runners. To-day suits me all right. And
Hank, mark my words, the thirteenth of the
month, you notice, is going to be a mighty unlucky
day for Elmer Craven, if I don’t miss my guess.
It’s skidoo for him, as sure as you’re born. So-long,
boys!”
</p>
<p>
Harry threw the sail around and immediately
the <em>Lightning</em> shot away with a sudden bound.
They opened a big gap between themselves and
the three boys standing there on the ice; but Paul,
looking back could see Hank and his comrades
waving their caps and sending out cheers that
came but faintly to the ears of those who were
speeding so rapidly up the river.
</p>
<p>
As a rule the Conoque ran due north and
south, though there were places where abrupt
turns were the exception. And as the breeze was
almost due west this allowed of almost unlimited
possibilities in sailing, with a craft so sensitive to
the slightest breath of air as an iceboat on a
smooth, mirror-like surface.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
It took them but a short time to reach and pass
the village of Rushville, situated on the left bank
of the Conoque River. Of course quite a number
of persons were enjoying the skating at this point;
and the moment the <em>Lightning</em> came into view
around the bend half a mile below, loud shouts attested
to the interest taken in her appearance.
</p>
<p>
Again did Harry slow up, as Paul wished to
ask questions of these boys. The news received
was to the effect that some time before Elmer
and Pud Snooks had passed up, and incidentally
come near running over a little child, as they
purposely swung in as if to show just how close
they could come to anyone without hitting them.
The Rushville boys were quite indignant, and
talking about it when the second iceboat hove in
sight.
</p>
<p>
“On again, Harry,” sang out Paul, after they
had learned all they wanted to know. “We’ll
run across them somewhere above; and perhaps
Elmer Craven will be in for the surprise of his
life. Somehow I just feel that this is my day; and
I want to make the most of it. Let her go, fellows;
and thank you for telling us.”
</p>
<p>
Harry had for the time being quite forgotten
all about his troubles; and this was just what his
chum desired most of all. Indeed, perhaps it was
more to accomplish this than anything else that
he sought a meeting with Elmer; though, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
course, boy-like, he did want to even the old score,
and pay up his debt.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve never been up this far before, I
reckon?” he remarked, after they had left Rushville
several miles behind.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a fact, Paul,” came the reply. “And
I never dreamed that the Conoque was such a
dandy stream for this sort of thing. Why, in
places it’s fully a quarter of a mile from bank to
bank. Yes, I’m glad I’ve come with you, Paul.”
</p>
<p>
“And perhaps you’ll be more than glad before
the morning passes,” Paul was saying to himself;
for he knew just how matters stood between
Harry and Elmer; and that if they could manage
to humiliate the proud, boastful spirit of the rich
man’s son, it must be more or less of a satisfaction
to Harry.
</p>
<p>
Two minutes later and Paul gave vent to a cry.
</p>
<p>
“Look yonder!” he exclaimed. “A mile ahead
the Cranberry flows into the Conoque; and unless
my eyes deceive me there’s an iceboat coming
whooping down that smaller stream. Yep,
that’s the <em>Glider</em>, as sure as anything. I ought
to know her build; and Harry, get ready now to
show them <em>a streak of greased lightning</em>!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—HARRY PILOTS THE LIGHTNING</h2>
<p>
“So that’s Elmer’s boat, is it?” remarked
Harry, as he managed to catch a fleeting glimpse
of the tall mast of a rapidly moving craft, that
was sweeping down the ice covered tributary of
the Conoque, now partly hidden behind a clump
of trees, and again passing a fairly open spot.
</p>
<p>
“Head in so as to be ready to follow after him,
whichever way he turns,” advised Paul, his voice
betraying signs of excitement; for he had been
looking forward to this same meeting for many
weeks, and anticipating the pleasures of turning
the tables on his boasting rival of long standing.
</p>
<p>
But Harry seemed as cool as though there were
nothing at stake. He had schooled himself to repress
his feelings when a great emergency arose,
calling for calm judgment, as well as quick action.
</p>
<p>
“I think I’ve got the course we want,” he remarked,
quietly, as the <em>Lightning</em> bore well in
toward the shore, just below the junction of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
two rivers. “I don’t dare pass too far in, because
you see that high bank, and the bunch of
trees, interfere with the wind, and we’d get blanketed.
There they come, Paul!”
</p>
<p>
Shooting out from the Cranberry like a thing
of life, the rival iceboat made a graceful sweep
and continued up the river.
</p>
<p>
“They did that on purpose!” cried Paul, as
though a bit disgusted at the turn affairs had
taken. “Let him say what he will, I believe Elmer
is afraid of this boat. He came and examined
her the day I rigged her up; and although he pretended
to laugh, I could just see that he was
chewing the rag. Yes, look at Pud waving his
hand at us; and he’s shouting something too.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” said Harry, without the least show
of worry; “we’ve got our work cut out for us, that’s
all. You know something about the river above;
can we run any distance with the boats?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” answered the other member of the
crew; “it’s the most obliging old river you ever
heard tell of. Miles and miles it stretches away,
sometimes narrow, and again broad; but if this
wind only holds out, we can spin along like fun
for more’n an hour. Hit her up, Harry, let’s see
just what the bully contraption carries up her
sleeve. After ’em with a hot stick now!”
</p>
<p>
Really, Harry needed no urging. The spirit of
sport had been fully aroused in his breast. Forgotten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
for the time being, were all those grim
troubles that had of late been making life so miserable
for the boy. He only seemed to remember
that once more his hand grasped the tiller of a
staunch ice flier; and that a derisive challenge had
floated back from the boat ahead.
</p>
<p>
And possibly, the fact that the two fellows
who manned the <em>Glider</em> were his most bitter and
unscrupulous enemies, had more or less to do with
Harry’s determination to beat the rival boat. He
would not have been human had he felt otherwise;
and while Harry possessed many fine attributes,
he was after all, only a boy at heart.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Lightning</em> had, of course, lost considerable
of her headway when the skipper ran in so
close to the high bank; but she was gradually
veering further away now, with every second.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the opposing boat had come
out of the Cranberry under a full sail; and shifting
her course, was running up the Conoque with
a speed that opened quite a gap between the rival
craft.
</p>
<p>
Then in turn Harry and Paul saw that they
were getting opposite the mouth of the smaller
stream, where the wind would be wholly unobstructed.
No sooner had this occurred than they
jumped ahead as though some unseen power had
taken the boat in tow.
</p>
<p>
“How about it now?” asked the skipper, wishing to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
Paul report progress; as he had about
all he could do in taking care of the skimming ice
craft, watching how the wind acted on the sail,
keeping a cautious eye out for any obstruction in
the way of a branch of a tree frozen in the ice,
or possibly an air hole which, if not avoided,
might spell disaster to the pursuing boat.
</p>
<p>
“We are sure holding our own, Harry!” exclaimed
Paul, delightedly.
</p>
<p>
That was an experience new to him; for up to
now the <em>Glider</em> had mocked all efforts to equal
her extraordinary speed. But Harry knew that,
as yet, he had not put the new boat to her “best
licks,” as he termed it. She was capable of better
things.
</p>
<p>
This was just the time and opportunity for one
who knew all about the tricks which an iceboat is
capable of developing, to coax her to show her
fine points; and that was what Harry was now
starting to do.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the boats were about equal in merit.
Possibly, had the crews been reversed, Harry and
Paul could have overtaken the <em>Lightning</em>, given
time with the older craft. In other words, it was
a case of superior knowledge and ability on the
part of the skipper of the <em>Lightning</em>, rather than
the possession of a better boat; for the <em>Glider</em>
was certainly what she had always been called, a
“marvel.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wow! we’re gaining, I do believe, Harry!”
announced Paul, a minute later; and there was a
touch of actual doubt in his voice, as though the
fact might be almost too good to be true.
</p>
<p>
“Are we?” answered his chum, just as though
it were nothing more than he had been expecting
right along.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, as sure as anything we must be,” Paul
went on excitedly. “I’m trying to judge distances
with my eye; and honest now, I believe
we’re not so far behind as when we first passed
the mouth of the Cranberry! Oh! it’s great!
Keep her moving just as she is, Harry! Do you
think you can? That wasn’t only a spurt, I
hope!”
</p>
<p>
“She can do even better than that, Paul. Watch
me now, for I’m on to a new little dodge. Keep
an eye for blow-holes, and branches frozen in
the ice. And Paul, shift your weight just a trifle
this way. I believe the balance will be more
even.”
</p>
<p>
Another short interval followed. Then Paul
gave vent to his delight again.
</p>
<p>
“You did something then that just made her
hump herself. Why, Harry, we’re clawing up on
the old <em>Glider</em> hand over fist! Look at ’em moving
around, will you? They’re getting scared,
that’s what! Elmer never yet saw another boat
creeping up after him when he was doing his level
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
best to fly. Bully! Bully! Oh, ain’t we just
humming along, though!”
</p>
<p>
It was no easy matter to speak while they were
cutting through space at such a tremendous pace
and Paul would have done better to have saved
his breath; but he had waited and hoped for this
great day so long, that he just could not bottle up
his delight.
</p>
<p>
Not a sound could they hear around them save
the whistle of the wind through the ropes above,
or the sharp humming music of the runners spurning
the smooth ice. Pud had long since ceased to
shout derisive cries back at the pursuers. His
scorn and mocking gestures had changed into
nervous movements, as he tried to increase the
speed of the <em>Glider</em> by altering his position from
time to time.
</p>
<p>
When another five minutes had passed, though
it seemed an hour to the impatient Paul, they had
gained so much upon the other boat that the two
were now within easy speaking distance. Yet
strange to say, those on the <em>Glider</em> maintained a
dead silence, that was quite unusual to their buoyant
natures. It makes considerable difference
whether one is on a winning or a losing craft.
</p>
<p>
Paul, however, could not keep still. This experience
almost set him wild with delight. And
where could you find a boy who would decline to
rub it in a little, given the chance?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hey! you there!” he hallooed, using his hands
as a megaphone; “get out of the way, and give
us room. We’re going to pass you, and let you
take our dust! Sheer off to one side, and let us
have the middle of the river! We’ve earned the
right of way. Lively now, Elmer! You’re a
back number after this, with your out-of-date boat!
To the scrap heap for yours!”
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it was hardly kind of Paul to add to
the humiliation which Elmer must naturally be
feeling, as he thus saw that the <em>Glider</em> was plainly
playing “second fiddle” to the new iceboat; but it
must be remembered that for years now, the son
of the richest man in Rivertown had lost no opportunity
to sneer at Paul, and humiliate him when
he had the chance.
</p>
<p>
Apparently the two who crouched there on the
<em>Glider</em> were at their wits’ ends to discover some
means for increasing their speed. They seemed to
be exchanging warm sentences, and Harry even
thought he heard Elmer’s rasping voice raised in
anger, as though he might be trying to lay the
burden of the blame on the bully, whose extra
weight might be just the cause for the difference
in speed of the two boats.
</p>
<p>
Pud could also be heard answering back, and it
sounded as though he were telling his comrade
that the fault lay in his lack of skill in managing
the <em>Glider</em>, rather than the handicap of weight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
</p>
<p>
“Can we pass ’em, d’ye think?” gasped Paul,
as they drew still closer to the leading boat, on
which a dead silence had now fallen.
</p>
<p>
“Easy enough, unless Elmer chooses to play
some trick on us,” replied Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! would he dare do that, when we’re spinning
along at this mad clip?” demanded the owner
of the new boat.
</p>
<p>
“You know him better than I do, Paul,” replied
Harry. “I don’t like the look on his face.
He keeps turning his head, then grinning in a
nasty way; after which he looks ahead, just as if
he was sizing up some desperate chance. I think
he means to foul us up if he can; and anyhow it’s
going to be a hard thing to pass him up here,
where nobody can see any dirty play.”
</p>
<p>
Paul seemed to consider. No doubt discretion
urged him to call the race off; but on the other
hand he disliked very much to quit just when he
had his rival where he had wanted to see him so
long.
</p>
<p>
A fisherman never calls a trout his own until
he has the prize in his hands; even though he may
humanely throw the speckled beauty back into the
water again. And in a race it does not really
count, unless you actually pass your adversary.
</p>
<p>
So Paul, with boyish recklessness, determined to
take the chances for trouble, and pass the <em>Glider</em>,
come what might. He knew Elmer to be somewhat reckless;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
but found it hard to believe that
the other would risk having his own bones broken,
just to smash the successful boat of his rival.
</p>
<p>
But Paul counted wrongly. Elmer, when he
became enraged, was not the same cool, calculating
schemer that he had the name of being under
normal conditions. And, urged on by the sarcastic
sneers of the ugly Pud, as well as his own keen
disappointment at seeing his pet iceboat fairly
beaten, he might even take chances which at another
time would have appalled him.
</p>
<p>
“That’s too bad!” Paul heard Harry exclaim.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what’s happened?” Paul cried, in sudden
alarm. “Are we going to lose out, after all that
magnificent gain? But Harry, see, we’re still
creeping up! Only twenty feet more, and we’ll be
on even terms! What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Look far ahead!” answered Harry.
</p>
<p>
“I see that the river narrows again,” the other
boy replied instantly. “Is that what you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. We’re going to have to try and pass,
while in that narrow stretch!” Harry sent across
to his reclining chum; for their heads were only a
few feet apart.
</p>
<p>
“But there’s plenty of room for both! I remember
that cut well, Harry! I had my canoe
upset there once, shooting the rapids when the
river was low in Summer. Yes, it’s sure wide
enough for even five boats abreast!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
</p>
<p>
“If they’re piloted by honest fellows, who mean
to deal squarely with each other,” said Harry,
significantly.
</p>
<p>
Paul was conscious of the fact that his chum
was putting the decision squarely up to him. He
felt a little uneasy. What if they should meet
with a serious accident in trying to pass the
<em>Glider</em> in such confined quarters? Was it right
for him to drag Harry into this peril?
</p>
<p>
“What ought we do, Harry?” he demanded,
quickly; for they were rushing toward the place
where the banks of the Conoque drew closer together,
and fast overtaking the rival boat.
</p>
<p>
“Are you willing to take the risk?” came the
immediate reply.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but how about you?” asked Paul.
</p>
<p>
“I’m with you, Paul,” the pilot sent back, impetuously.
“The chance is too good to be lost.
And perhaps I can find a way to outwit him, if
he tries any funny business. Be ready to do your
part like lightning, if I give the word.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m on! Go it, for all you’re worth, Harry!”
</p>
<p>
There was really no time for further words.
They had now reached the beginning of the narrows,
and at the same time found themselves close
up with the tail end of the other iceboat.
</p>
<p>
Paul, sending one nervous glance that way,
could see Pud Snooks glaring at them as though
he could eat either of the two alive. There was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
an expression on his heavy face that bordered on
desperation; and Paul became more than ever
convinced that Elmer and his crony must have
made up their minds to attempt some crooked
play, in the hope of balking the efforts of the
<em>Lightning’s</em> crew to pass them.
</p>
<p>
All this while Harry had been studying his
chances. He had purposely come up from behind,
and had chosen the leeward side of the
boat in advance. This was done with a distinct
purpose. If, as he expected, Elmer altered the
course of the <em>Glider</em>, and attempted to block
their way, Harry meant to suddenly shift his
helm and shoot up on the windward side.
</p>
<p>
This movement he calculated to make so suddenly
as to momentarily confuse the opposing pilot.
And when Elmer could collect his senses enough
to follow suit he would be just so many seconds
too late; for by that time possibly the <em>Lightning</em>
might be on even terms; and the big sail would
blanket the <em>Glider</em>, shutting off the wind that was
so essential to her forward progress.
</p>
<p>
Then perhaps, before she could recover from
this staggering blow, the <em>Lightning</em>, which would
not have lost her headway for even a second,
might be out of reach, and rapidly leaving her outwitted
rival in the lurch.
</p>
<p>
At such a time as this it requires an active
brain to hatch up a scheme that carries with it a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
chance of success. Fortunately Harry was built
that way. He saw his opportunity, and grasped
it without hesitation.
</p>
<p>
Paul, as yet, had not the remotest idea just how
his chum meant to work the deal. He recognized
the fact that those on the other boat would try
to get in the way, regardless of accidents, and
block their passage. Thus Elmer would always
claim that he had never been passed by any other
iceboat, and if both craft were reduced to kindling
wood by the collision, little he cared in his present
reckless frame of mind.
</p>
<p>
But Paul had the utmost confidence in his comrade.
He had seen Harry in action before now,
and recognized the fact that he was gifted with a
bright mind, capable of grasping the situation,
and turning even a little thing to advantage.
</p>
<p>
And so he just lay there, holding on for dear
life, ready to “take his medicine,” as he termed
it, should there be a spill; and also keeping himself
in readiness to do his little part should the
skipper give a quick order; for it was Paul’s duty
to look after the sail, and handle the sheet if they
had to tack during their run, with the wind heading
them off.
</p>
<p>
Now they were nosing up, so that the fore part
of the <em>Lightning</em> seemed but a yard or two behind
the rudder of the opposing craft, once called the
“Queen of the Conoque,” but apparently destined to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
yield up that proud title to the later
model owned by Paul Martin.
</p>
<p>
“Ha!”
</p>
<p>
It was Paul himself who gave utterance to this
exclamation. Apparently he had been holding his
breath for half a minute past, in anticipation of
what was to come; and this signified that the
startling event was being put into play.
</p>
<p>
Elmer had shifted his tiller just enough to
change the course of his boat, and veer slightly to
leeward. Of course this necessitated a change in
the running of the pursuing craft, otherwise the
<em>Lightning</em> must immediately strike the stern of the
leader.
</p>
<p>
Harry followed suit, and for a moment both
boats continued on that slant. But it could not
last, of course. The shore was too close by; and
if they continued to veer to leeward both must
go aground, to the utter demoralization of the
delicate craft.
</p>
<p>
Paul could see that leering face of Pud almost
within reach of his hand. It seemed as though
the bully might be asking what he was going to
do about it; and giving him to understand that he
might as well cut his halyards, and let his sail
drop, because he and Elmer were grimly determined
that no iceboat should ever sail past the
<em>Glider</em>, come what might.
</p>
<p>
So Paul set his teeth hard, expecting a spill of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
some sort when the bow of his boat struck the
stern of the other, while going at this amazing
speed. Perhaps his face was white, which fact
could hardly be wondered at under the circumstances.
But there was no sign of fear there.
Paul proved game when the test came, just as
Harry had known would be the case.
</p>
<p>
A foot—why the distance between the two
boats must be measured by inches now, so rapidly
had it been cut down by the rush of the pursuing
craft.
</p>
<p>
Just as Paul gave a gasp, expecting to feel the
shock of the collision, and perhaps be tumbled
headlong over the smooth ice, he felt Harry make
a sudden move.
</p>
<p>
The skipper of the <em>Lightning</em> had waited until
the very last second, and then swung the tiller
around!
</p>
<p>
Instantly obeying the rudder, the able boat
changed her course. She no longer headed to
leeward, but swung in the other direction, aiming
for the windward bank of the river.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! bully! bully! bully!” cried Paul, as the
plan of his chum flashed across his mind; and at
the same time he occupied himself in tugging at
the sheet in order to shape the bellying sail to the
new course of the rapidly-driven boat.
</p>
<p>
Apparently Elmer was taken quite by surprise
by this movement on the part of his rival. His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
mind was not quite equal to grasping the full significance
of it, and responding so rapidly that he
might still have a chance of bringing about a disastrous
collision.
</p>
<p>
When he swung around, Pud was also slow to
do his duty with the rope governing the sail. He
had been altogether wrapped up in setting himself
for the anticipated shock of an upset; so that
it took him several seconds to grasp the new conditions.
</p>
<p>
When they did succeed in changing their course,
just before bringing up on the lee shore, it
seemed as though it might be too late, for the able
<em>Lightning</em> had improved her opportunity in a
glorious manner.
</p>
<p>
Elmer was seized with a fit of blind fury. He
realized that he had been beaten at his own game,
and by the boy whom he had always felt that
sense of unjust hatred ever since the day Harry
Watson first came to the Rivertown High School,
and carried off the honors of that bob-sled dash
down the hill.
</p>
<p>
The one thing he wanted to do now was to
smash into the <em>Lightning</em>, regardless of consequences.
Elmer believed in the “rule or ruin”
policy. If his boat was no longer to be the fastest
on the Conoque, he would at least never allow
another to carry off the honors.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
</p>
<p>
And so the reckless boy deliberately headed for
the rival craft, his aim being to come down upon
the port quarter of the frail <em>Lightning</em> with such
an impetus that the other boat must be utterly
demolished.
</p>
<p>
Paul saw what was impending. His quivering
words of delight ceased to flow; for again he
feared that this implacable and unscrupulous foe
was in a position to carry out his quickly-conceived
scheme of revenge.
</p>
<p>
But Harry knew better. His quick and experienced
eye judged distances better than that of
his chum. True, he edged in a bit closer toward
the nearby shore; but that may have been for a
double purpose. It gave him a trifle longer to
make the pull; and at the same time rendered the
possibility of Elmer and Pud coming to grief a
<em>certainty</em>.
</p>
<p>
Five seconds is not a very long stretch of time;
and yet there may be times in the experiences of
some people when it seems next door to an eternity.
And Paul was now feeling something that
way.
</p>
<p>
He saw the oncoming <em>Glider</em> rushing down at
them—he could mark the strained faces of the
two desperate fellows who sprawled there on the
thin planking that served as a deck to the runners—and
he caught his breath with a queer little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
click as he wondered whether after all Harry was
going to carry his clever game through to a successful
end; or if the new boat was destined to be
smashed then and there on its first glorious cruise.
</p>
<p>
Then the crisis came.
</p>
<p>
In changing his course so much, in order to
strike the <em>Lightning</em> squarely in the port quarter,
Elmer had failed to realize that he was heading
up in the teeth of the wind more than his rival.
And in this way he was handicapped so far as
keeping up his pace was concerned.
</p>
<p>
So the <em>Glider</em> swept to the rear of the new boat,
just comfortably missing her. The victory had
been won, since the <em>Lightning</em> had thus forged
ahead, and passed her rival!
</p>
<p>
Paul started to give a whoop of delight. Then
he stopped, for there was heard a sudden loud
smash as the boat of the baffled plotters struck the
shore.
</p>
<p>
“She’s done for! Gone to flinders, Harry!
Oh, what a race, and they’ve got just what they
deserve. But I hope neither of them has been
badly hurt!” exclaimed Paul, who, even in the
excitement of victory could think of the defeated
foe.
</p>
<p>
“I feel the same way as you do about it, Paul,”
replied the pilot at the tiller of the now undisputed
champion of the Conoque, as he headed
straight up the narrows toward the wide reach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
above; “but I don’t think that cuts much figure in
it, for I’m sure I saw Pud jump to his feet out of
the wreck; while Elmer was crawling out, and
limping around as we turned that bend just below.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, if ever a sly schemer got caught in his
own trap that fellow was,” remarked Paul, his
indignation now getting the better of his sympathy.
“And he sure deserves all he’s got.
We’ll go on a way further, and then turn back.
Perhaps we’ll overtake our two friends, the
enemy, limping along the ice on the way home;
and they may even accept a lift back.”
</p>
<p>
But after all, Paul’s good intentions were fated
never to be put to the test, for although they saw
the wrecked <em>Glider</em> piled up in a shattered heap
on the shore in the narrows, nothing of the two
unlucky skippers was discovered on the way down
the river; and they concluded the boys had made
their way ashore, to hire some farmer to drive
them all the way back to Rivertown.
</p>
<p>
When the story of the eventful race was told
to the boys of Rivertown most of them declared
that Elmer and Pud had been paid in their own
coin; and few sympathized with them when they
appeared on the streets with sundry strips of court
plaster decorating their faces, and with decided
limps.
</p>
<p>
“At any rate,” said Paul, as he separated from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
his chum at the Watson gate, “we <em>did</em> have a
great time of it; and I reckon it’s done you a heap
of good, Harry,” in which opinion the other certainly
shared; and declared that he was glad he
had accepted the invitation to try the new iceboat.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV—“ALL’S WELL THAT ENDS WELL”</h2>
<p>
Keeping more and more to himself, Harry
finally gave up the pleasure of skating with his
friends after school, preferring to go on long
runs alone.
</p>
<p>
As he was gliding over the ice on one of these
occasions, he saw a girl and a boy skating well
out toward the middle of the river, so far from
him that he could not recognize them.
</p>
<p>
For two days before, there had been a decided
thaw and the ice in the middle of the river was
not considered safe by the majority of the skaters.
Accordingly, when Harry beheld the two figures,
he was amazed.
</p>
<p>
“Must be from Lumberport or Cardell,” he
told himself. “None of our people would be foolish
enough to go out there. Guess I’ll see who
it is.”
</p>
<p>
And without delay, he started toward the
couple.
</p>
<p>
“Good gracious! It’s Viola and Craven!” he
gasped, when he was near enough to get a good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
look at them. For a moment, the boy was uncertain
what to do. The girl had been keeping more
and more aloof from him, and correspondingly
more and more in the company of the rich student;
and well he knew that Elmer would resent his advice
in some insulting manner.
</p>
<p>
To his relief, however, the couple seemed to be
so engrossed in one another that they did not see
him, and after watching them for several minutes
he was on the point of turning away when he saw
them both sink, and then heard terrified screams
for help.
</p>
<p>
The cries also reached some of the other boys
and girls farther down the river, and they set out
to the assistance of the struggling skaters. But
none of them had the speed of Harry.
</p>
<p>
With a swiftness that was astounding, the boy
rushed over the ice toward the hole that was
constantly growing larger.
</p>
<p>
Badly frightened, both Viola and Elmer
clutched frantically at the edges of the ice, only
to have them break away, sometimes in small
chunks, again in large pieces.
</p>
<p>
“Let Viola hang onto the edge by herself. Go
farther down, you Craven!” shouted Harry as he
dashed toward them.
</p>
<p>
But instead of obeying, having found a piece
that would hold, the rich boy clung to it, allowing
Viola to be carried past him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if I were only in the water with him, I’d
fix the coward!” cried Harry. “I only wish the
others were near enough to see what he did.”
</p>
<p>
Thanks to his speed, our hero was so close to
the hole that he was obliged to exercise caution
lest he, too, break through.
</p>
<p>
“Here, give me a hand. That ice’ll hold
you!” shouted Elmer, as his rival approached.
</p>
<p>
But Harry seemed not to hear him.
</p>
<p>
“Hey, you fool, get me out of this; then we
two can get Viola.”
</p>
<p>
His pleading, however, was without avail.
Straight along the edge of the hole Harry skated
until he was abreast of the girl of whom he was
so fond.
</p>
<p>
“Just keep hold of that ice cake a few moments
longer,” he called encouragingly. “I’ll have you
out in no time.”
</p>
<p>
“But I’m too far from the edge. You never
can reach me!” sobbed Viola. And as she saw
the firm ice so close to her, she made a frantic
effort to swim out, with the result that she lost
her hold on the floating ice cake.
</p>
<p>
Harry had been hoping that the current would
carry the girl in toward a part of the river where
it would not be so difficult for him to get to her.
But the instant he saw her hands slip from the
cake, he sprang into the water.
</p>
<p>
Being a good swimmer, it required only a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
strokes for him to reach the side of the girl, but
as he did so his troubles began.
</p>
<p>
Handicapped by his clothes and his skates,
when Viola seized him in the despairing clutch of
a drowning person, he was almost drawn under.
</p>
<p>
“No, no, you mustn’t grab me around the
throat, Viola!” he gasped. “Put your hands on
my shoulders. If you don’t, you’ll drown us both.
I won’t let you sink—and if you’ll only do as I
tell you, I’ll have you safe and sound in a jiffy.”
</p>
<p>
Something there was in the tone in which the
boy spoke that not only soothed the frenzied girl,
but gave her confidence, and though she did not
remove her hands from around Harry’s neck, she
ceased her struggles, permitting him, by means
of the ice cakes, and treading water, to make his
way toward the firm ice.
</p>
<p>
The other boys and girls who were hastening
to the assistance of their schoolmates had watched
the rescue eagerly, and when they saw the boy
half roll, half lift the girl out onto the solid ice,
they cheered lustily.
</p>
<p>
But in saving Viola, Harry had overtaxed his
strength. Indeed, it had only been by putting
every ounce of his power into the effort that he
had been able to raise the girl from the water;
and the instant he saw her safe, he sank back.
</p>
<p>
The realization that she was on sound ice, however,
restored the girl to her senses; and as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
beheld the boy who had saved her from the icy
waters lose his hold, she spun about; and with a
quick move, caught his coat sleeve as his arm
went up in the air.
</p>
<p>
To the task of pulling Harry from the water,
however, Viola was not equal.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry! Hurry! Help me!” she shouted to
the leaders of the other would-be rescue party.
“I can’t hold him much longer!”
</p>
<p>
“Hey, you, come and get me first! I’ve been
in the water longer!” yelled Elmer.
</p>
<p>
But fortunately for Harry, it was Paul and
Jerry who were in the van of the skaters, and at
Viola’s cries, they put on every ounce of speed
they had, relieving her of her hold just in the nick
of time.
</p>
<p>
Harry, however, was more used up than the
others had believed, and it was several minutes before
he opened his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Is—is Viola safe?” he gasped.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, I am, Harry!” returned the girl,
bending over him. And there was a light in her
eyes that thrilled the boy who had rescued her.
</p>
<p>
When he tried to get up, Harry found he had
no strength.
</p>
<p>
“Somebody go get a sled,” commanded Longback.
</p>
<p>
“And let him lie here cold and wet, while you’re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
going for it?” stormed Viola. “Pick him up
and carry him, some of you.”
</p>
<p>
Instantly Paul, Jerry, Dawson and another boy
seized Harry, and half supporting, half carrying
him, they got him to the shore, while Nettie and
the other girls helped Viola, leaving Elmer to
the tender mercies of Pud and Socker, who had
finally arrived in time to drag him from the water.
</p>
<p>
But even they wasted few words on him,
ashamed as they were to think that he should have
sought to save himself at the sacrifice of Viola.
</p>
<p>
Straight to bed did Mrs. Watson put Harry
when he was brought to the house, giving him
warming drinks; while his chums rubbed his benumbed
arms and legs. But he did not respond
to their treatment as quickly as he should, and in
alarm, his aunt finally sent for a doctor.
</p>
<p>
Grave, indeed, did the man of medicine look
after he had completed his examination of the
boy.
</p>
<p>
“If he’d been exposed for another half hour, I
doubt if we could have brought him around,” he
announced. “As it is, it will be several days before
he will be up and about.”
</p>
<p>
But the physician was mistaken—his days were
weeks.
</p>
<p>
His nervous system overtaxed because of his
worry in regard to his father, Harry’s physical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
condition had run down, and the chill he received
caused him to go off into pneumonia.
</p>
<p>
Harry’s illness, however, served one good purpose—it
caused a reaction in the feelings of his
schoolmates. When it became noised around
that he had endangered his life to rescue the girl
who was skating with his implacable enemy, the
boys and girls of Rivertown High realized that
he was made of good material. And their change
in feelings was shown by calls they made to ask
about his condition, and the delicacies they sent in.
But only Paul, Jerry and finally Viola were allowed
to see him, though they were forbidden to
talk to him.
</p>
<p>
Little, indeed, did he talk, and then only to ask
if word had come from Jed Brown. And as his
aunt was forced, day after day, to declare that she
had heard nothing, the boy seemed to lose all interest
in getting well.
</p>
<p>
But the crippled veteran, though silent, had
not deserted the boy who had rescued him from
the bully.
</p>
<p>
Arrived in Lawrenceburgh, he had vainly
pleaded with several influential men to arrange for
a stay in the execution of sentence upon Harry’s
father. But one and all, they turned a deaf ear
to his pleadings, and Mr. Watson was forced to
go to prison.
</p>
<p>
But on the very day he entered upon his term
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
of punishment, old Jed stumbled upon a clue
which was to prove his innocence.
</p>
<p>
Chancing to drop into a tobacco store which
was kept by one of his war comrades, he was
amazed to find still another member of his old
company dressed in handsome clothes and wearing
a diamond ring. As the man had always been a
ne’er-do-well, the change in his circumstances
puzzled Jed, and when the fellow had taken his
departure, he asked the shop-keeper what had
caused it.
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I’d like to find out,” returned
the tobacconist. “For the last six months, Bill
has been going around with his pockets full of
money. He’s living at the Ransom House, too.”
</p>
<p>
This being one of the chief hotels in Lawrenceburgh,
the fact still further emphasized the turn
in the veteran’s fortunes.
</p>
<p>
“Ever give you any idea how he got the
money?” asked Jed.
</p>
<p>
“Says he done it by writing. Bill always was
a good writer, you know. Don’t you remember
how he used to forge pass orders for some of the
boys when they wanted to leave camp?”
</p>
<p>
The words sent an idea to Jed’s mind, and bidding
the shop-keeper a hasty good-bye, he hied
himself to the Ransom House, where he made
many inquiries about the former soldier. At first
he made little headway; but just as he was giving up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
in despair, he saw another old comrade.
</p>
<p>
“Say, what’s the matter with you Rivertown
folks?” asked this man. “Have you come down
to see Bill Hawkins, too? Ned Snooks visits him
about once a month.”
</p>
<p>
At the mention of the Rivertown butcher, the
crippled veteran gasped. Then he remembered
that bad feeling had sprung up between the
butcher and Mr. Watson over a real estate deal
in which the former maintained that he had been
swindled—and Jed immediately concluded that
Ned Snooks was at the bottom of the charges
against Harry’s father.
</p>
<p>
But it was one thing to believe this, and quite
another to prove it—yet with that perseverance
which had distinguished him as a soldier in the
ranks, Jed set about obtaining evidence; and finally
succeeded in extracting a confession from
Hawkins, that, acting for the butcher, he had
forged the name of Snooks to some checks, and
managed to lay the blame on Amos Watson.
</p>
<p>
Elated, Jed again approached the influential
men who had refused to intercede for their fellow
townsman, and after convincing them of the
truth of the confession, received their aid in obtaining
Mr. Watson’s release from prison, and
subsequent exoneration from the charge of forgery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p>
Ignorant of the illness of Harry, the old veteran
did not report on his progress, and the first
news the boy had of the change in his father’s condition
was when a telegram was brought to him.
</p>
<p>
With trembling fingers he opened it, then uttered
a faint cry of joy, as he read:
</p>
<p style='text-align:left; margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0; margin-left:2em;;'>“Harry Watson,</p>
<p style='text-align:left; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-left:2em;;'>Rivertown.</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
Charges against me proven false. I want you
to come to Lawrenceburgh to spend Sunday with
me.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'><span class='sc'>Father.</span>”</p>
<p>
Better than any tonic or care was the news to
Harry, and though he was not able to go to his
father, Mr. Watson came to him, bringing good
old Jed Brown with him, and happy, indeed, was
the reunion.
</p>
<p>
Despite his villainy, Mr. Watson refused to
prosecute Ned Snooks; but public opinion was so
aroused against the butcher that he sold his property,
and moved away from Rivertown, while the
man he had so wronged decided to live in the
town, and in due course opened a real estate office.
</p>
<p>
“But didn’t Pud know about this forgery from
the first?” asked Harry, of his parent, one day.
</p>
<p>
“I think not, my son,” replied Mr. Watson.
“Mr. Snooks was a man who kept his affairs to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
himself. Had Pud known he would have taunted
you long before he did.”
</p>
<p>
“It was grand of old Jed Brown to act as he
did,” murmured our hero. “We owe him a great
deal.”
</p>
<p>
“He is to live with me and your Aunt Mary
after this,” said the father. “He is going to help
me in my real estate business. As he is getting
old, I shall let him take it as easy as he pleases.”
And so it was arranged.
</p>
<p>
When Harry returned to Rivertown High he
was given an ovation that made him blush like a
girl. The only person who remained in the background
was Elmer Craven. He had nothing to
say; and when, during the following Fall, the
Craven family moved to Boston, Elmer was glad
to go along, so he would not have to return to a
school where he was in such bad odor.
</p>
<p>
Harry continued at Rivertown High School for
the full term of four years; and when he graduated
he did so at the top of his class. Then he
went into the real estate business with his father,
and both made money rapidly. His friendship
for Viola ripened into a much more tender feeling;
and it is reported that some day the pair will be
married. But though Harry was successful as a
land dealer he never became tired of talking about
his high-school days.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
</p>
<p>
“We had some great times,” he said, one day,
to Paul.
</p>
<p>
“We sure did!” replied his chum. “In my
opinion there is no better school in all the world
than Rivertown High!”
</p>
<p>
“Right you are!” responded Harry. “And as
matters have turned out I am very glad that I
came here.”

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
